1   this framework will be applied on a consolidated basis to internationally active         banks
 consolidated supervision is  best means to provide supervisors with a         comprehensive view of risks and to reduce opportunities for regulatory arbitrage
    10
2   the scope of application of  framework will include
 on a fully consolidated         basis
 any holding company  is  parent entity within a banking group to         ensure  it captures  risk of  whole banking group
 banking groups are         groups  engage predominantly in banking activities and
 in some countries
 a         banking group may be registered as a bank
      a holding company  is a parent of a banking group may itself have                     a parent holding company
 in some structures
 this parent holding                     company may not be subject to this framework because it is not                     considered a parent of a banking group
      10
3   the framework will also apply to all internationally active banks at every tier         within a banking group
 also on a fully consolidated basis

 to supplement consolidated supervision
 it is essential to ensure          capital recognised in capital adequacy measures is adequately distributed         amongst legal entities of a banking group
 accordingly
 supervisors should test          individual banks are adequately capitalised on a stand-alone basis

 it captures  risks of a whole banking                     group
 although  framework recognises  need for adequate                     capitalisation on a stand-alone basis
 it does not prescribe how to                     measure  solo capital requirements which is left to individual                     supervisory authorities

1   to  greatest extent possible
 all banking and or relevant financial activities         
both regulated and unregulated
 conducted within a group containing an         internationally active bank will be captured through consolidation
 thus
 majority
        owned or
controlled banking entities
 securities entities 
where subject to         broadly similar regulation or where securities activities are deemed banking         activities
 and or financial entities should generally be fully consolidated
 the         treatment of minority interests and or capital issued out of consolidated         subsidiaries  is held by third parties is set out in cap10
        financial activities do not include insurance activities and financial                     entities do not include insurance entities
    examples of  types of activities  financial entities might be                     involved in include financial leasing
 issuing credit cards
 portfolio                     management
 investment advisory
 custodial and safekeeping services                     and or similar activities  are ancillary to  business of banking
      30
2   there may be instances where it is not feasible or desirable to consolidate certain         securities or or regulated financial entities
 this would be only in cases where         such holdings are acquired through debt previously contracted and held on a         temporary basis
 are subject to different regulation
 or where non-consolidation         for regulatory capital purposes is orwise required by law
 in such cases
 it is         imperative for  bank supervisor to obtain sufficient information from         supervisors responsible for such entities
    30
3   if any majority-owned securities and or financial subsidiaries are not         consolidated for capital purposes
 all equity and or regulatory capital 
or
 if         applicable
 or total loss-absorbing capacity
 investments in those entities         attributable to  group will be deducted 
as described in cap30
""
 and  assets         and liabilities
 as well as third-party capital investments in  subsidiary will be         removed from  banks balance sheet
 supervisors will ensure  an entity          is not consolidated and for which  capital investment is deducted meets         regulatory capital requirements
 supervisors will monitor actions taken by          subsidiary to correct any capital shortfall and
 if it is not corrected in a timely         manner
  shortfall will also be deducted from  parent banks capital
          30
4   significant minority investments in banking
 securities and or financial entities
         where control does not exist
 will be excluded from  banking groups capital         by deduction of  equity and or regulatory investments 
as described in         cap30
""
 alternatively
 such investments might be
 under certain conditions
         consolidated on a pro rata basis
 for example
 pro rata consolidation may be         appropriate for joint ventures or where  supervisor is satisfied   parent         is legally or de facto expected to support  entity on a proportionate basis only         and  or significant shareholders have  means and  willingness to         proportionately support it
" the threshold above which minority investments will         be deemed significant and be thus eir deducted or consolidated on a pro-rata         basis is to be determined by national accounting and/or regulatory practices"
 as         an example
  threshold for pro-rata inclusion in  european union is defined         as equity interests of between 20% and 50%
      insurance entities  30
5   a bank  owns an insurance subsidiary bears  full entrepreneurial risks of          subsidiary and should recognise on a group-wide basis  risks included in          whole group
 when measuring regulatory capital for banks
  committee         believes  it is
 in principle
 appropriate to deduct banks equity and or         regulatory capital investments in insurance subsidiaries and also significant         minority investments in insurance entities
 under this approach  bank would         remove from its balance sheet assets and liabilities
 as well as third party capital         investments in an insurance subsidiary
 the banks equity or or capital         investment in  insurance subsidiary is n treated according to cap30
21 to         cap30
34
 alternative approaches  can be applied should
 in any case
 include         a group-wide perspective for determining capital adequacy and avoid double         counting of capital
 banks should also disclose  national regulatory approach         used with respect to insurance entities in determining ir reported capital         positions 
see dis30
""
               faq       faq1      can significant investments in insurance entities
 including fully owned                 insurance subsidiaries

28 to cap30
34                 ?                   jurisdictions can permit or require banks to consolidate significant                 investments in insurance entities as an alternative to  deduction                 approach on  condition   method of consolidation results in a                 minimum capital standard  is at least as conservative as                  which would apply under  deduction approach
 ie  consolidation                 method cannot result in banks benefiting from higher capital ratios                 than would apply under  deduction approach
                   in order to ensure this outcome
 banks  apply a consolidation                 approach are required to calculate ir capital ratios under both                  consolidation approach and  deduction approach
 at each period                  y report or disclose se ratios
                   in cases when  consolidation approach results in lower capital ratios                 than  deduction approach 
ie consolidation has a more conservative                 outcome than deduction
""
 banks will report se lower ratios
 in cases                 when  consolidation approach results in any of  banks capital                 ratios being higher than  ratios calculated under  deduction                 approach 
ie consolidation has a less conservative outcome than                 deduction
""
  bank must adjust  capital ratio downwards through                 applying a regulatory adjustment 
ie a deduction
 to  relevant                 component of capital

6   the capital invested in a majority-owned or
controlled insurance entity may         exceed  amount of regulatory capital required for such an entity 
surplus         capital
""
 supervisors may permit  recognition of such surplus capital in         calculating a banks capital adequacy
 under limited circumstances and subject to         disclosure 
see dis30
""
 national regulatory practices will determine          parameters and criteria
 such as legal transferability
 for assessing  amount         and availability of surplus capital  could be recognised in bank capital
 or         examples of availability criteria include
 restrictions on transferability due to         regulatory constraints
 to tax implications and to adverse impacts on external         credit assessment institutions ratings
 where a bank does not have a full         ownership interest in an insurance entity 
eg 50% or more but less than 100%         interest
""
 surplus capital recognised should be proportionate to  percentage         interest held
 surplus capital in significant minority-owned insurance entities will         not be recognised
 as  bank would not be in a position to direct  transfer of          capital in an entity which it does not control
       in a deduction approach
  amount deducted for all equity and or                     regulatory capital investments will be adjusted to reflect  amount of                     capital in those entities  is in surplus to regulatory requirements
 ie                      amount deducted would be  lesser of  investment or                      regulatory capital requirement
 the amount representing  surplus                     capital
 ie  difference between  amount of  investment in                     those entities and ir regulatory capital requirement
 would be risk
                    weighted as an equity investment
 if using an alternative group-wide                     approach
 an equivalent treatment of surplus capital will be made
      30
7   supervisors will ensure  majority-owned or controlled insurance subsidiaries
         which are not consolidated and for which capital investments are deducted or         subject to an alternative group-wide approach
 are mselves adequately         capitalised to reduce  possibility of future potential losses to  bank
         supervisors will monitor actions taken by  subsidiary to correct any capital         shortfall and
 if it is not corrected in a timely manner
  shortfall will also be         deducted from  parent banks capital

        introduction  40
1   the negative externalities associated with institutions  are perceived as not         being allowed to fail due to ir size
 interconnectedness
 complexity
 lack of         substitutability or global scope are well recognised
 in maximising ir private         benefits
 individual financial institutions may rationally choose outcomes 
 on         a system-wide level
 are suboptimal because y do not take into account se         externalities
 moreover
  moral hazard costs associated with implicit         guarantees derived from  perceived expectation of government support may         amplify risk-taking
 reduce market discipline and create competitive distortions
         and furr increase  probability of distress in  future
 as a result
  costs         associated with moral hazard add to any direct costs of support  may be         borne by taxpayers
    40
2   in addition
 given  potential cross-border repercussions of a problem in any of          global systemically important banks 
g-sibs
 on  financial institutions in         many countries and on  global economy at large
 this is not uniquely a         problem for national authorities
 and refore requires a global minimum         agreement
    40
3   because re is no single solution to  externalities posed by g-sibs
          official community is addressing se issues through a multipronged approach
         the broad aim of  policies is to
           
1
 reduce  probability of failure of g-sibs by increasing ir going-concern             loss-absorbency 
addressed by  measures in this chapter
 rbc40 and             or g-sib-specific measures in  basel framework

 and           
2
 reduce  extent or impact of failure of g-sibs

      assessing systemic importance  40
4   the basel committees methodology for assessing  systemic importance of g
        sibs relies on an indicator-based measurement approach
 the selected indicators         are chosen to reflect  different aspects of what generates negative         externalities and makes a bank critical for  stability of  financial system
 the         advantage of  multiple indicator-based measurement approach is  it         encompasses many dimensions of systemic importance
 is relatively simple and is         more robust than currently available model-based measurement approaches and         methodologies  rely on only a small set of indicators or market variables
          40
5         given  focus of  framework on cross-border spillovers and negative global         externalities  arise from  failure of a globally active bank
  reference         system for assessing systemic impact is  global economy
 consequently
         systemic importance is assessed based on data  relate to  consolidated         group 
ie  unit of analysis is  consolidated group
""
 to be consistent with         this approach
  higher loss absorbency requirement applies to          consolidated group
 however
 as with  minimum requirement and  capital         conservation and countercyclical buffers
 application at  consolidated level         does not rule out  option for  host jurisdictions of subsidiaries of  group         also to apply  requirement at  individual legal entity or consolidated level         within ir jurisdiction
    40
6   the committee is of  view  global systemic importance should be         measured in terms of  impact  a banks failure can have on  global         financial system and wider economy
 rar than  likelihood  a failure         could occur
 this can be thought of as a global
 system-wide
 loss-given-default         
lgd
 concept rar than a probability of default 
pd
 concept
    40
7   the methodology gives an equal weight of 20% to each of five categories of         systemic importance
 which are
 size
 cross-jurisdictional activity
         interconnectedness
" substitutability/financial institution infrastructure and         complexity"
 with  exception of  size category
  committee has identified         multiple indicators in each of  categories
 with each indicator equally weighted         within its category
 except for  substitutability category
 that is
 where re         are two indicators in a category
 each indicator is given a 10% overall weight
         where re are three
  indicators are each weighted 6
67% 
"ie 20/3"
""
 in          substitutability category
 two indicators are weighted 6
67% 
assets under         custody and payment activity
""
 while underwritten transactions in debt and equity         markets and  new trading volume indicator each weigh 3
33%
 this split         reflects  complementary role of  trading volume indicator
 which is to         capture potential disruptions in  provision of liquidity in  secondary market         for some exposures
 while  underwriting indicator captures liquidity in          primary market
    40
8   in 2013
  committee found 
 relative to  or categories  make up          g-sib framework
  substitutability category has a greater impact on          assessment of systemic importance than  committee intended for banks          are dominant in  provision of payment
 underwriting and asset custody         services
 therefore
  committee decided to apply a cap to  substitutability         category by limiting  maximum score to 500 basis points
          40
9   the global systemically important insurers framework does not formally capture          insurance subsidiaries of banking groups
 furrmore
 some jurisdictions         include insurance subsidiaries in ir regulatory scope of consolidation whilst         ors do not
 which may create an inconsistency in  systemic assessment of         banking groups across jurisdictions
 against this background
  committee has         decided to include insurance activities for  following indicators

10 for each bank
  score for a particular indicator is calculated by dividing         individual bank amount 
expressed in eur
 by  aggregate amount for         indicator summed across all banks in  sample
 this amount is n multiplied        by 10
000 to express  indicator score in terms of basis points
 for example
 if a        banks size divided by  total size of all banks in  sample is 0
03 
ie  bank        makes up 3% of  sample total
 its score will be expressed as 300 basis points
        each category score for each bank is determined by taking a simple average of         indicator scores in  category
 the overall score for each bank is n        calculated by taking a simple average of its five category scores and n        rounding to  nearest whole basis point
 the maximum total score
 ie  score         a bank would have if it were  only bank in sample
 is 10
000 basis points        
ie 100%

  data must be converted from         reporting currency to euros using  exchange rates published on  basel        committee website

  average rates over         banks fiscal year should be used to convert  individual payments data into         banks reporting currency

      cross-jurisdictional activity  40
13 given  focus on g-sibs
  objective of this indicator is to capture banks        global footprint
 two indicators in this category measure  importance of         banks activities outside its home 
headquarter
 jurisdiction relative to overall        activity of or banks in  sample
           
1
 cross-jurisdictional claims
 and           
2
 cross-jurisdictional liabilities
    40
14 the idea is   international impact of a banks distress or failure would vary        in line with its share of cross-jurisdictional assets and liabilities
 the greater a        banks global reach
  more difficult it is to coordinate its resolution and         more widespread  spillover effects from its failure
      size  40
15 a banks distress or failure is more likely to damage  global economy or        financial markets if its activities comprise a large share of global activity
 the        larger  bank
  more difficult it is for its activities to be quickly replaced by        or banks and refore  greater  chance  its distress or failure would        cause disruption to  financial markets in which it operates
 the distress or        failure of a large bank is also more likely to damage confidence in  financial        system as a whole
 size is refore a key measure of systemic importance
 one        indicator is used to measure size
  measure of total exposures used in         basel iii leverage ratio
 including exposures arising from insurance subsidiaries
          interconnectedness  40
16 financial distress at one institution can materially increase  likelihood of        distress at or institutions given  network of contractual obligations in which        se firms operate
 a banks systemic impact is likely to be positively related to        its interconnectedness vis--vis or financial institutions
 three indicators are        used to measure interconnectedness
 all of which include insurance subsidiaries
           
1
 intra-financial system assets
           
2
 intra-financial system liabilities
 and

"      substitutability / financial institution infrastructure  40"
17 the systemic impact of a banks distress or failure is expected to be negatively        related to its degree of substitutability as both a market participant and client        service provider
 ie it is expected to be positively related to  extent to which         bank provides financial institution infrastructure
 for example
  greater a        banks role in a particular business line
 or as a service provider in underlying        market infrastructure 
eg payment systems
""
  larger  disruption will likely be        following its failure
 in terms of both service gaps and reduced flow of market        and infrastructure liquidity
 at  same time
  cost to  failed banks        customers in having to seek  same service from anor institution is likely to        be higher for a failed bank with relatively greater market share in providing         service
" four indicators are used to measure substitutability/financial institution        infrastructure"

 its business
 structural and operational        complexity
 the more complex a bank is
  greater are  costs and time        needed to resolve  bank
 three indictors are used to measure complexity

      sample of banks  40
19 the indicator-based measurement approach uses a large sample of banks as its        proxy for  global banking sector
 data supplied by this sample of banks is n        used to calculate banks scores
 banks fulfilling any of  following criteria will be        included in  sample and will be required to submit  full set of data used in         assessment methodology to ir supervisors

      bucketing approach  40
20 banks  have a score produced by  indicator-based measurement approach         exceeds a cutoff level are classified as g-sibs
 supervisory judgment may        also be used to add banks with scores below  cutoff to  list of g-sibs
 this        judgment will be exercised according to  principles set out in sco40
23 to        sco40
26
    40
21 each year
  committee runs  assessment and
 if necessary
 reallocates g
       sibs into different categories of systemic importance based on ir scores and        supervisory judgment
 g-sibs are allocated into equally sized buckets based on        ir scores of systemic importance
 with varying levels of higher loss absorbency        requirements applied to  different buckets as set out in rbc40
4 and rbc40
5
        the cutoff score for g-sib designation is 130 basis points and  buckets        corresponding to  different higher loss absorbency requirements each have a        range of 100 basis points
    cutoff scores and bucket thresholds are available at       40
22 the number of g-sibs
 and ir bucket allocations
 will evolve over time as banks        change ir behaviour in response to  incentives of  g-sib framework as        well as or aspects of basel iii and country-specific regulations
 moreover
 if a        banks score increases such  it exceeds  top threshold of  fourth bucket
        new buckets will be added to accommodate  bank
 new buckets will be equal        in size in terms of scores to each of  existing buckets
 and will have        incremental higher loss absorbency requirements
 as set out in rbc40

5
 to provide incentives for banks to avoid becoming more systemically        important
      criteria for supervisory judgment  40
23 supervisory judgment can support  results derived from  indicator-based        measurement approach of  assessment methodology
 the committee has        developed four principles for supervisory judgment
           
1
 the bar for judgmental adjustment to  scores should be high
 in             particular
 judgment should only be used to override  indicator-based             measurement approach in exceptional cases
 those cases are expected to be             rare
           
2
 the process should focus on factors pertaining to a bank  global systemic             impact
" ie  impact of  banks distress/failure and not  probability of             distress/failure "
ie  riskiness
 of  bank
           
3
" views on  quality of  policy/resolution framework within a jurisdiction             should not play a role in this g-sib identification process"
           
4
 the judgmental overlay should comprise well documented and verifiable             quantitative as well as qualitative information
          however
 this is not meant to preclude any or actions                       committee
"  fsb or national supervisors may wish to take for global                     systemically important financial institutions to address  quality of                      policy/resolution framework"
 for example
 national supervisors                     could impose higher capital surcharges beyond  higher loss                     absorbency requirements for g-sibs  do not have an effective and                     credible recovery and resolution plan
        ancillary indicators  40
24 the committee has identified a number of ancillary indicators relating to specific        aspects of  systemic importance of an institution  may not be captured by         indicator-based measurement approach alone
 these indicators can be used        to support  judgment overlay
    40
25 the ancillary indicators are set out in  reporting template and related        instructions
 which are available on  committees website
              qualitative supervisory judgment  40
26 supervisory judgment can also be based on qualitative information
 this is        intended to capture information  cannot be easily quantified in  form of        an indicator
 for example
 a major restructuring of a banks operation
 qualitative        judgments should also be thoroughly explained and supported by verifiable        arguments
      process for incorporating supervisory judgment  40
27 the supervisory judgmental overlay can be incorporated using  following        sequential steps to  score produced by  indicator-based measurement        approach
           
1
 collection of  data and supervisory commentary for all banks in              sample
                 
2
 mechanical application of  indicator-based measurement approach and             corresponding bucketing
           
3
 relevant authorities propose adjustments to  score of individual banks             on  basis of an agreed process
           
4
 the committee develops recommendations for  fsb
           
5
 the fsb and national authorities
 in consultation with  basel committee
             make final decisions
      the data collection can start in  second quarter and be finalised in                     third quarter each year
 subject to consultation with national                     supervisors
    relevant authorities mainly refer to home and host supervisors
      40
28 the supervisory judgment input to  results of  indicator-based        measurement approach should be conducted in an effective and transparent way        and ensure   final outcome is consistent with  views of  committee        as a group
 challenges to  results of  indicator-based measurement        approach should only be made if y involve a material impact in  treatment        of a specific bank 
eg resulting in a different loss absorbency requirement
""
 to        limit  risk  resources are used ineffectively
 when  authority is not         banks home supervisor it would be required to take into account  views of         banks home and major host supervisors
 these could be
 for instance
         members of  institutions college of supervisors
    40
29 in addition to  materiality and consultation requirements
 proposals to        challenge  indicator-based measurement approach will be subject to         following modalities
 proposals originating from  home supervisor  result        in a lower loss absorbency requirement would be scrutinised and would require a        stronger justification than those resulting in a higher loss absorbency        requirement
 the reverse would apply to proposals originating from or        authorities
 those recommending a higher loss-absorbency requirement would be        subject to higher standards of proof and documentation
 the rationale for this        asymmetric treatment follows  general principle   committee is setting        minimum standards
          periodic review and refinement  40
30 the methodology
 including  indicator-based measurement approach itself
"         cutoff/threshold scores and  size of  sample of banks"
 are regularly        monitored and reviewed by  committee in order to ensure  y remain        appropriate in light of
 
i
 developments in  banking sector
 
ii
 progress in        methods and approaches for measuring systemic importance
 
iii

iv
 any evidence of material unintended consequences or material        deficiencies with respect to  objectives of  framework
 as regards         structural changes in regional arrangements  in particular in  european        banking union  y will be reviewed as actual changes are made
    40
31 the committee expects national jurisdictions to prepare a framework in which        banks are able to provide high-quality data for  indicators
 in order to ensure         transparency of  methodology
  committee expects banks to disclose        relevant data and has set out disclosure requirements in sco40
32 to sco40
34
        the committee discloses  values of  cutoff scores
  threshold scores for        buckets
  denominators used to normalise  indicator values and  g-sib        indicators of all banks so  banks
 regulators and market participants can        understand how actions banks take could affect ir systemic importance score        and reby  applicable magnitude of  hla requirement
      disclosure requirements  40
32 for each financial year-end
 all banks with a leverage ratio exposure measure
        including exposures arising from insurance subsidiaries
  exceeded eur 200        billion in  previous year-end 
using  exchange rate applicable at         financial year-end
 should be required by national authorities to make publicly        available  13 indicators used in  assessment methodology
 banks should        note in ir disclosures  those figures are subject to revision and        restatement
    40
33 banks below this threshold  have been added to  sample owing to        supervisory judgment or as a result of being classified as a g-sib in  previous        year would also be required to comply with  disclosure requirements
    40
34 banks should also be required by national authorities to publicly disclose if         data used to calculate  g-sib scores differ from  figures previously        disclosed
 to  extent  a revision to  data is required
 banks should        disclose  accurate figures in  financial quarter immediately following         finalisation of  committees g-sib score calculation

                                      introduction  50
1   the committee has developed a set of principles  constitutes  domestic         systemically important bank 
d-sib
 framework
 the 12 principles can be broadly         categorised into two groups
  first group 
sco50
5
 focuses mainly on          assessment methodology for d-sibs while  second group 
rbc40
7
 focuses         on higher loss absorbency 
hla
 for d-sibs
      hla refers to higher loss absorbency relative to  basel iii                     requirements for internationally active banks
 for domestic banks                      are not internationally active
 hla is relative to requirements for                     domestic banks
      50
2   the principles were developed to be applied to consolidated groups and         subsidiaries
 however
 national authorities may apply m to branches in ir         jurisdictions in accordance with ir legal and regulatory frameworks
      while  application to branches of  principles regarding                      assessment of systemic importance should not pose any specific                     problem
  range of policy responses  host authorities have                     available to deal with systemic branches in ir jurisdiction may be                     more limited
      50
3   the additional requirements applied to global systemically important banks 
g
        sibs
""
 which apply over and above  basel requirements applying to all         internationally active banks
 are intended to limit  cross-border negative         externalities on  global financial system and economy associated with          most globally systemic banking institutions
 similar externalities can apply at a         domestic level
 there are many banks  are not significant from an         international perspective
 but neverless could have an important impact on         ir domestic financial system and economy compared to non-systemic         institutions
 some of se banks may have cross-border externalities
 even if          effects are not global in nature
          50
4   a d-sib framework is best understood as taking  complementary perspective         to  g-sib regime by focusing on  impact   distress or failure of         banks 
including by international banks
 will have on  domestic economy
 as         such
 it is based on  assessment conducted by  local authorities
 who are         best placed to evaluate  impact of failure on  local financial system and          local economy
 this point has two implications
           
1
 the first is 
 in order to accommodate  structural characteristics of             individual jurisdictions
  assessment and application of policy tools should             allow for an appropriate degree of national discretion
 this contrasts with              prescriptive approach in  g-sib framework
           
2
 the second implication is 
 because a d-sib framework is still relevant for             reducing cross-border externalities due to spillovers at regional or bilateral             level
  effectiveness of local authorities in addressing risks posed by             individual banks is of interest to a wider group of countries
 a d-sib             framework
 refore
 should establish a minimum set of principles
 which             ensures  it is complementary with  g-sib framework
 addresses             adequately cross-border externalities and promotes a level playing field
      principles on  d-sib assessment methodology  50
5   the principles on  d-sib assessment methodology are set out below
           
1
 national authorities should establish a methodology for assessing              degree to which banks are systemically important in a domestic context
           
2
 the assessment methodology for a d-sib should reflect  potential impact             of
 or externality imposed by
 a bank  failure
           
3
 the reference system for assessing  impact of failure of a d-sib should be              domestic economy
           
4
 home authorities should assess banks for ir degree of systemic             importance at  consolidated group level
 while host authorities should             assess subsidiaries in ir jurisdictions
 consolidated to include any of ir             own downstream subsidiaries
 for ir degree of systemic importance
                 
5
 the impact of a d-sib  failure on  domestic economy should
 in principle
             be assessed having regard to bank-specific factors
" national authorities can             consider or measures / data  would inform  bank-specific             indicators within each of  below factors"
 such as size of  domestic             economy
               
a
 size
               
b
 interconnectedness
               
c
"   substitutability / financial institution infrastructure "
including                   considerations related to  concentrated nature of  banking                   sector
""
 and               
d
 complexity 
including  additional complexities from cross-border                 activity
""
           
6
 national authorities should undertake regular assessments of  systemic             importance of  banks in ir jurisdictions to ensure  ir assessment             reflects  current state of  relevant financial systems and               interval between d-sib assessments not be significantly longer than  g
            sib assessment frequency
           
7
 national authorities should publicly disclose information  provides an             outline of  methodology employed to assess  systemic importance of             banks in ir domestic economy
      principles 1 and 2
 assessment methodologies  50
6   a starting point for  development of principles for  assessment of d-sibs is         a requirement  all national authorities should undertake an assessment of          degree to which banks are systemically important in a domestic context
 the         rationale for focusing on  domestic context is outlined in sco50
10
    50
7   sco40
6 states  global systemic importance should be measured in terms of          impact  a failure of a bank can have on  global financial system and         wider economy rar than  likelihood  a failure can occur
 this can be         thought of as a global
 system-wide
 loss-given-default 
lgd
 concept rar than         a probability of default 
pd
 concept
 consistent with  g-sib methodology
          committee is of  view  d-sibs should also be assessed in terms of          potential impact of ir failure on  relevant reference system
 one implication         of this is  to  extent  d-sib indicators are included in any         methodology
 y should primarily relate to impact of failure measures and         not risk of failure measures
          principles 3 and 4
 reference system and scope of assessment  50
8   two key aspects  shape  d-sib framework and define its relationship to          g-sib framework relate to how it deals with two conceptual issues with         important practical implications
           
1
 what is  reference system for  assessment of systemic impact
 and           
2
 what is  appropriate unit of analysis 
ie  entity which is being             assessed
?    50
9   for  g-sib framework
  appropriate reference system is  global         economy
 given  focus on cross-border spillovers and  negative global         externalities  arise from  failure of a globally active bank
 as such this         allowed for an assessment of  banks  are systemically important in a         global context
 the unit of analysis was naturally set at  globally consolidated         level of a banking group 
sco40
5 states  systemic importance is assessed         based on data  relate to  consolidated group
""
    50
10 correspondingly
 a process for assessing systemic importance in a domestic        context should focus on addressing  externalities  a banks failure        generates at a domestic level
 thus
  committee is of  view          appropriate reference system should be  domestic economy
 ie  banks        would be assessed by  national authorities for ir systemic importance to         specific jurisdiction
 the outcome would be an assessment of banks active in         domestic economy in terms of ir systemic importance
    50
11 in terms of  unit of analysis
  committee is of  view  home        authorities should consider banks from a 
globally
 consolidated perspective
 this        is because  activities of a bank outside  home jurisdiction can
 when         bank fails
 have potential significant spillovers to  domestic 
home
 economy
        jurisdictions  are home to banking groups  engage in cross-border        activity could be impacted by  failure of  whole banking group and not just         part of  group  undertakes domestic activity in  home economy
"        this is particularly important given  possibility   home government may        have to fund/resolve  foreign operations in  absence of relevant cross"
       border agreements
 this is in line with  concept of  g-sib framework
          50
12 when it comes to  host authorities
  committee is of  view  y        should assess foreign subsidiaries in ir jurisdictions
 also consolidated to        include any of ir own downstream subsidiaries
 some of which may be in or        jurisdictions
 for example
 for a cross-border financial group headquartered in        country x
  authorities in country y would only consider subsidiaries of         group in country y plus  downstream subsidiaries
 some of which may be in        country z
 and ir impact on  economy y
 thus
 subsidiaries of foreign        banking groups would be considered from a local or sub-consolidated basis from         level starting in country y
 the scope should be based on regulatory        consolidation as in  case of  g-sib framework
 therefore
 for  purposes        of assessing d-sibs
 insurance or or non-banking activities should only be        included insofar as y are included in  regulatory consolidation
    50
13 the assessment of foreign subsidiaries at  local consolidated level also        acknowledges  fact   failure of global banking groups could impose        outsized externalities at  local 
host
 level when se subsidiaries are        significant elements in  local 
host
 banking system
 this is important since        re exist several jurisdictions  are dominated by foreign subsidiaries of        internationally active banking groups
      principle 5
 assessing  impact of a d-sibs failure  50
14 the g-sib methodology identifies five broad categories of factors  influence        global systemic importance
 size
 cross-jurisdictional activity
 interconnectedness
"        substitutability/financial institution infrastructure and complexity"
 the indicator
       based approach and weighting system in  g-sib methodology was developed        to ensure a consistent international ranking of g-sibs
 the committee is of         view  this degree of detail is not warranted for d-sibs
 given  focus is on         domestic impact of failure of a bank and  wide ranging differences in each        jurisdictions financial structure hinder such international comparisons being        made
 this is one of  reasons why  d-sib framework has been developed as        a principles-based approach
    50
15 consistent with this view
 it is appropriate to list
 at a high level
  broad        category of factors 
eg size
  jurisdictions should have regard to in assessing         impact of a d-sib  failure
 among  five categories in  g-sib framework
        size
 interconnectedness
" substitutability/financial institution infrastructure and        complexity are all relevant for d-sibs as well"
 cross-jurisdictional activity
         remaining category
 may not be as directly relevant
 since it measures  degree        of global 
cross-jurisdictional
 activity of a bank which is not  focus of  d
       sib framework
          50
16 in addition
 national authorities may choose to also include some country-specific        factors
 a good example is  size of a bank relative to domestic gross domestic           product 
gdp
""
 if  size of a bank is relatively large compared to  domestic         gdp
 it would make sense for  national authority of  jurisdiction to identify         it as a d-sib whereas a same-sized bank in anor jurisdiction
 which is smaller         relative to  gdp of  jurisdiction
 may not be identified as a d-sib
    50
17 national authorities should have national discretion as to  appropriate relative        weights y place on se factors depending on national circumstances
      principle 6
 regular assessment of systemic importance  50
18 the committee believes it is good practice for national authorities to undertake a        regular assessment as to  systemic importance of  banks in ir financial        systems
 the assessment should also be conducted if re are important        structural changes to  banking system such as
 for example
 a merger of major        banks
 a national authoritys assessment process and methodology will be        reviewed by  committees implementation monitoring process
    50
19 it is also desirable   interval of  assessments not be significantly longer        than  for g-sibs 
ie one year
""
 for example
 a systemically important bank        could be identified as a g-sib but also a d-sib in  same jurisdiction or in or        host jurisdictions
 alternatively
" a g-sib could drop from  g-sib list and        become/continue to be a d-sib"
 in order to keep a consistent approach in se        cases
 it would be sensible to have a similar frequency of assessments for  two        frameworks
      principle 7
 transparency on  methodology  50
20 the assessment process used needs to be clearly articulated and made public so        as to set up  appropriate incentives for banks to seek to reduce  systemic        risk y pose to  reference system
 this was  key aspect of  g-sib        framework where  assessment methodology and  disclosure requirements        of  committee and  banks were set out in  g-sib rules text
 by taking        se measures
  committee sought to ensure  banks
 regulators and        market participants would be able to understand how  actions of banks could        affect ir systemic importance score and reby  required magnitude of        additional loss absorbency
 the committee believes  transparency of         assessment process for  d-sib framework is also important
 even if it is likely        to vary across jurisdictions given differences in frameworks and policy tools used        to address  systemic importance of banks

1   regulatory capital consists of three categories
 each governed by a single set of         criteria  instruments are required to meet before inclusion in  relevant         category
           
1
 common equity tier 1

gone-concern capital
    10
2   total regulatory capital is  sum of common equity tier 1
 additional tier 1 and         tier 2 capital
 net of regulatory adjustments described in cap30
 tier 1 capital is          sum of common equity tier 1 and additional tier 1 capital
 net of          regulatory adjustments in cap30 applied to those categories
    10
3   it is critical  banks risk exposures are backed by a high-quality capital base
         to this end
  predominant form of tier 1 capital must be common shares and         retained earnings
    10
4   throughout cap10  term bank is used to mean bank
 banking group or         or entity 
eg holding company
 whose capital is being measured
    10
5   a bank must seek prior supervisory approval if it intends to include in capital an         instrument which has its dividends paid in anything or than cash or shares
      common equity tier 1  10
6   common equity tier 1 capital consists of  sum of  following elements
           
1
 common shares issued by  bank  meet  criteria for classification as             common shares for regulatory purposes 
or  equivalent for non-joint             stock companies

3
 retained earnings
           
4
 accumulated or comprehensive income and or disclosed reserves
               
5
 common shares issued by consolidated subsidiaries of  bank and held by             third parties 
ie minority interest
  meet  criteria for inclusion in             common equity tier 1 capital

 regulatory adjustments applied in  calculation of common equity tier 1
    10
7   retained earnings and or comprehensive income include interim profit or loss
         national authorities may consider appropriate audit
 verification or review         procedures
 dividends are removed from common equity tier 1 in accordance         with applicable accounting standards
 the treatment of minority interest and          regulatory adjustments applied in  calculation of common equity tier 1 are         addressed in separate sections
             faq         faq1       does retained earnings include  fair value changes of additional                    tier 1 and tier 2 capital instruments?                      retained earnings and or reserves
 as stated on  balance sheet
                    are positive components of common equity tier 1
 to arrive at                    common equity tier 1
  positive components are adjusted by                     relevant regulatory adjustments set out in cap30
                      no regulatory adjustments are applied to fair value changes of                    additional tier 1 or tier 2 capital instruments  are recognised on                     balance sheet
 except in respect of changes due to changes in                     banks own credit risk
 as set out in cap30
15
                      for example
 consider a bank with common equity of 500 and a tier 2                    capital instrument  is initially recognised on  balance sheet as a                    liability with a fair value of 100
 if  fair value of this liability on                     balance sheet changes from 100 to 105
  consequence will be a                    decline in common equity on  banks balance sheet from 500 to                    495
 if this change in fair value is due to factors or than own credit                    risk of  bank
 eg prevailing changes in interest rates or exchange                    rates
  tier 2 capital instrument should be reported in tier 2 at a                    valuation of 105 and  common equity should be reported as 495

 national authorities may allow common shares paid as                 compensation to be those of  banks holding company
 this is                 permitted because neir  issuance of shares of  bank nor                  issuance of shares of  holding company affect  level of common                 equity created at  bank when  liability represented by  capital                 instruments is written off

" is it correct   relevant authority in jurisdiction of                  consolidated supervisor must have  power to trigger writedown /                 conversion of  instrument in addition to  relevant authority in                  jurisdiction of  foreign subsidiary?                   yes"
 this is correct
         faq6      to ensure   scope of application of  non-viability trigger is                 exercised consistently across jurisdictions does  basel committee                 intend to issue any furr guidance on what constitutes  point of                 non-viability?                   banks should seek advice from ir relevant national authority if y                 have questions about national implementation
         faq7      how should conversion at  point of non-viability operate for issues                 out of spvs?                   the write-off of  instruments issued from  spv to end investors                 should mirror  write-off of  capital issued from  operating                 entity or holding company to  spv
 banks should discuss wher                  specific arrangements of each instrument meet this broad concept                 with ir relevant national authority
       faq8      assuming compliance with all relevant legal conditions  may exist                 can  compensation upon  point of non-viability trigger be paid in                  form of common shares of  holding company of  bank?                   yes
 national authorities may allow common shares paid as                 compensation to be those of  banks holding company
 this is                 permitted because neir  issuance of shares of  bank nor                  issuance of shares of  holding company affect  level of common                 equity created at  bank when  liability represented by  capital                 instruments is written off
 national authorities may require  banks                  intend to do this seek  relevant authoritys approval before                  issuance of such capital instruments

 the amount recognised as regulatory capital should be adjusted to                 account for any dtls or tax payment resulting from  conversion or                 writedown or any or foreseeable tax liability or tax payment related                 to  instruments due at  moment of conversion or writedown or                 write-off

 taking into account in particular  local tax treatment                 and  structure of  group
                   where netting of dtls against deferred tax assets is allowed
 banks                 should seek guidance from supervisory authorities on  treatment of                 dtls associated with  conversion

         faq10     regarding  reform of benchmark reference rates

 a reassessment could result in an existing                 capital instrument being treated as a new instrument
 this in turn                    could result in breaching  minimum maturity and call date                     requirements
 similarly
 existing capital instruments issued under basel                     ii  are being phased out could also fail to meet eligibility                     requirements if y are treated as new instruments
 the committee                     confirms  amendments to capital instruments pursued solely for                      purpose of implementing benchmark rate reforms will not result in                     m being treated as new instruments for  purpose of assessing                      minimum maturity and call date requirements or affect ir eligibility                     for transitional arrangements of basel iii

         holdings of regulatory capital and or tlac liabilities should reflect                      investing banks actual exposure to  issuer as regulatory capital                     or tlac

 g-sibs may be able to recognise instruments ranking pari         passu to excluded liabilities as external tlac up to a limit
 in accordance with          exemptions to  subordination requirements set out in  penultimate         paragraph of section 11 of  fsb tlac term sheet
 a banks holdings of such         instruments will be subject to a proportionate deduction approach
 under this         approach
 only a proportion of holdings of instruments  are eligible to be         recognised as external tlac by virtue of  subordination exemptions will be         considered a holding of tlac by  investing bank
 the proportion is calculated         as
           
1
  funding issued by  g-sib resolution entity  ranks pari passu with             excluded liabilities and  is recognised as external tlac by  g-sib             resolution entity
 divided by           
2
  funding issued by  g-sib resolution entity  ranks pari passu with             excluded liabilities and  would be recognised as external tlac if              subordination requirement was not applied
      for example
 if a g-sib resolution entity has funding  ranks pari                     passu with excluded liabilities equal to 5% of risk-weighted assets

= 3
"5 / 5"
 of such instruments in                     calculating its tlac holdings
 the same proportion should be applied                     by  investing bank to any indirect or syntic investments in                     instruments ranking pari passu with excluded liabilities and eligible to                     be recognised as tlac by virtue of  subordination exemptions

 banks must calculate ir         holdings of or tlac liabilities of  respective issuing g-sib resolution         entities based on  latest available public information provided by  issuing         g-sibs on  proportion to be used

 which would be extinguished if          intangible assets become impaired or derecognised under  relevant         accounting standards

 under  equity method
  carrying amount of  investment                    includes any goodwill
 in line with cap30
7 a firm should calculate a                    goodwill amount as at  acquisition date by separating any excess of                     acquisition cost over  investors share of  net fair value of                     identifiable assets and liabilities of  banking

8   subject to prior supervisory approval
 banks  report under local gaap may         use  ifrs definition of intangible assets to determine which assets are         classified as intangible and are thus required to be deducted
          deferred tax assets  30
9   deferred tax assets 
dtas
  rely on future profitability of  bank to be         realised are to be deducted in  calculation of common equity tier 1
 dtas         may be netted with associated dtls only if  dtas and dtls relate to taxes         levied by  same taxation authority and offsetting is permitted by  relevant         taxation authority
 where se dtas relate to temporary differences 
eg         allowance for credit losses
  amount to be deducted is set out in cap30
32 to         cap30
34
 all or such assets
 eg those relating to operating losses
 such as          carry forward of unused tax losses
 or unused tax credits
 are to be deducted in         full net of deferred tax liabilities as described above
 the dtls permitted to be         netted against dtas must exclude amounts  have been netted against          deduction of goodwill
 intangibles and defined benefit pension assets
 and must         be allocated on a pro rata basis between dtas subject to  threshold deduction         treatment and dtas  are to be deducted in full
             faq         faq1       regarding  deduction of dtas
 is it correct  dtas resulting from                    net operating losses are not subject to  10% threshold? is it correct                      current test in some jurisdictions to check wher dtas are                    realisable within one year is not applicable under basel iii?                      all dtas  depend on  future profitability of  bank to be                    realised and  arise from net operating losses are required to be                    deducted from common equity tier 1 in full and so do not benefit from                     10% threshold
 the test applied in certain jurisdictions to assess                    wher a dta is realisable over a one year period is not applicable                    under basel iii
           faq2       given  dtas and dtls are accounting concepts
 what does it mean                    to say  offsetting is permitted by  relevant taxation authority?                      it means   underlying tax assets and tax liabilities must be                    permitted to be offset by  relevant taxation authority for any dtls                    and dtas created to be permitted to be offset in determining                     deduction from regulatory capital
           faq3       could  basel committee provide guidance on  treatment of                    deferred taxes in a tax regime in which dtas arising from temporary                    differences are automatically transformed into a tax credit in case a                    bank is not profitable
 is liquidated or is placed under insolvency                    proceedings? in  tax regime  tax credit can be offset against any                    tax liability of  bank or of any legal entity belonging to  same                           group as allowed under  national tax regime
 and if  amount of                     such tax liabilities is lower than such tax credit
 any exceeding amount                     of  tax credit will be cash refundable by  central government
 do                     banks have to deduct dtas arising from temporary differences in such                     tax regimes?                       no
 banks may apply a 100% risk weight for dtas arising from                     temporary differences in such tax regimes

10 an overinstallment of tax or
 in some jurisdictions
 current year tax losses carried        back to prior years may give rise to a claim or receivable from  government or        local tax authority
 such amounts are typically classified as current tax assets for        accounting purposes
 the recovery of such a claim or receivable would not rely        on  future profitability of  bank and would be assigned  relevant        sovereign risk weighting
      cash flow hedge reserve  30
11 the amount of  cash flow hedge reserve  relates to  hedging of items         are not fair valued on  balance sheet 
including projected cash flows
        should be derecognised in  calculation of common equity tier 1
 this means         positive amounts should be deducted and negative amounts should be        added back

12 this treatment specifically identifies  element of  cash flow hedge reserve         is to be derecognised for prudential purposes
 it removes  element         gives rise to artificial volatility in common equity

 in or words

19 this deduction is necessary to avoid  double-counting of a banks own capital

 indirect holdings via index funds and potential future holdings as         a result of contractual obligations to purchase own shares

 if a non-common equity instrument is                 being phased out from tier 1 by  issuing bank
 should  bank use                 full value of  instrument or  amount recognised by  issuing                 bank 
ie  phased-out value
 to determine  size of  holding                 subject to  deduction treatment?                   during  period in which instruments  do not meet  basel iii                 entry criteria are being phased out from regulatory capital

 is it correct  both banks in this                 example will include a long position on  equity exposure

as it has less than one year                 maturity
 and  buying bank must recognise  forward purchase                 
as all long positions are added irrespective of maturity
? also
 given                  fact  cash equity has no legal maturity
 how does  maturity                 matching requirement apply?                   in  example both banks will be considered to have long positions on                  equity exposure

  basel iii rules require                   maturity of  short position must eir match  maturity of                  long position or have a residual maturity of at least one year
                 therefore
 in  case of cash equity positions  short position must                        have a residual maturity of at least one year to be considered to offset                     cash equity position
 however
 after considering this issue
                     basel committee has concluded 
 for positions in  trading book
"                    if  bank has a contractual right/obligation to sell a long position at                    a specific point in time and  counterparty in  contract has an                    obligation to purchase  long position if  bank exercises its right                    to sell"
 this point in time may be treated as  maturity of  long                    position
 therefore if se conditions are met
  maturity of  long                    position and  short position are deemed to be matched even if                     maturity of  short position is within one year
           faq7       does  five working day exemption for underwriting positions begin                    on  day  payment is made by  underwriter to  issuing                    bank?                      cap30
22 relates to deductions of investments in or financial                    institutions
 where  underlying policy rationale is to remove                     double counting of capital  exists when such investments are made
                    when a bank underwrites  issuance of capital by anor bank
                     bank issuing capital will only receive recognition for this capital when                     underwriter makes  payment to  issuing bank to purchase                     capital instruments
 as such
  underwriting bank need not                    include  
committed
 purchase within investments in  capital of                    or financial institutions prior to  day on which payment is made                    by  underwriting bank to  issuing bank
 the five day                    underwriting exemption begins on  date on which this payment is                    made and effectively permits five working days where double counting                    can exist before  exposure must be subject to  deduction                    treatment outlined in cap30

 wher y are in                                    trading book or in  banking book
                                        introduction  50
1   this section provides banks with guidance on prudent valuation for positions          are accounted for at fair value
 wher y are in  trading book or in          banking book
 this guidance is especially important for positions without actual         market prices or observable inputs to valuation
 as well as less liquid positions         which raise supervisory concerns about prudent valuation
 the valuation         guidance set forth below is not intended to require banks to change valuation         procedures for financial reporting purposes
 supervisors should assess a banks         valuation procedures for consistency with this guidance
 one fact in a supervisors         assessment of wher a bank must take a valuation adjustment for regulatory         purposes under cap50
11 to cap50
14 should be  degree of consistency         between  banks valuation procedures and se guidelines
    50
2   a framework for prudent valuation practices should at a minimum include          following
      systems and controls  50
3   banks must establish and maintain adequate systems and controls sufficient to         give management and supervisors  confidence  ir valuation estimates         are prudent and reliable
 these systems must be integrated with or risk         management systems within  organisation 
such as credit analysis
""
 such         systems must include
           
1
 documented policies and procedures for  process of valuation
 this             includes clearly defined responsibilities of  various areas involved in              determination of  valuation
 sources of market information and review of             ir appropriateness
 guidelines for  use of unobservable inputs             reflecting  banks assumptions of what market participants would use in             pricing  position
 frequency of independent valuation
 timing of closing             prices
 procedures for adjusting valuations
 end of  month and ad-hoc             verification procedures
 and           
2
 clear and independent 
ie independent of front office
 reporting lines for              department accountable for  valuation process
 the reporting line should             ultimately be to a main board executive director
      valuation methodologies    marking to market          50
4   marking-to-market is at least  daily valuation of positions at readily available         close out prices  are sourced independently
 examples of readily available         close out prices include exchange prices
 screen prices
 or quotes from several         independent reputable brokers
    50
5   banks must mark-to-market as much as possible
" the more prudent side of bid         /offer should be used unless  institution is a significant market-maker in a         particular position type and it can close out at mid-market"
 banks should         maximise  use of relevant observable inputs and minimise  use of         unobservable inputs when estimating fair value using a valuation technique
         however
 observable inputs or transactions may not be relevant
 such as in a         forced liquidation or distressed sale
 or transactions may not be observable
 such         as when markets are inactive
 in such cases
  observable data should be         considered
 but may not be determinative
      marking to model    50
6   only where marking-to-market is not possible should banks mark-to-model
 but         this must be demonstrated to be prudent
 marking-to-model is defined as any         valuation which has to be benchmarked
 extrapolated or orwise calculated         from a market input
 when marking to model
 an extra degree of conservatism is         appropriate
 supervisory authorities will consider  following in assessing         wher a mark-to-model valuation is prudent
           
1
" senior management should be aware of  elements of  trading book or             or fair-valued positions which are subject to mark to model and should             understand  materiality of  uncertainty this creates in  reporting of              risk/performance of  business"
           
2
 market inputs should be sourced
 to  extent possible
 in line with market             prices 
as discussed above
""
 the appropriateness of  market inputs for              particular position being valued should be reviewed regularly
           
3
 where available
 generally accepted valuation methodologies for particular             products should be used as far as possible
           
4
 where  model is developed by  institution itself
 it should be based on             appropriate assumptions
 which have been assessed and challenged by             suitably qualified parties independent of  development process
 the             model should be developed or approved independently of  front office
 it             should be independently tested
 this includes validating  mamatics
              assumptions and  software implementation
                 
5
 there should be formal change control procedures in place and a secure             copy of  model should be held and periodically used to check valuations
           
6
 risk management should be aware of  weaknesses of  models used             and how best to reflect those in  valuation output
           
7
 the model should be subject to periodic review to determine  accuracy of             its performance 
eg assessing continued appropriateness of  assumptions
             analysis of profit and loss versus risk factors
 comparison of actual close out             values to model outputs
""
           
8
 valuation adjustments should be made as appropriate
 for example
 to cover              uncertainty of  model valuation 
see also valuation adjustments in             cap50
9 to cap50
14
      independent price verification    50
7   independent price verification is distinct from daily mark-to-market
 it is          process by which market prices or model inputs are regularly verified for         accuracy
 while daily marking-to-market may be performed by dealers
         verification of market prices or model inputs should be performed by a unit         independent of  dealing room
 at least monthly 
or
" depending on  nature         of  market/trading activity"
 more frequently
""
 it need not be performed as         frequently as daily mark-to-market
 since  objective
 ie independent
 marking         of positions
 should reveal any error or bias in pricing
 which should result in          elimination of inaccurate daily marks
    50
8   independent price verification entails a higher standard of accuracy in           market prices or model inputs are used to determine profit and loss figures
         whereas daily marks are used primarily for management reporting in between         reporting dates
 for independent price verification
 where pricing sources are         more subjective
 eg only one available broker quote
 prudent measures such as         valuation adjustments may be appropriate
      valuation adjustments  50
9   as part of ir procedures for marking to market
 banks must establish and         maintain procedures for considering valuation adjustments
 supervisory         authorities expect banks using third-party valuations to consider wher         valuation adjustments are necessary
 such considerations are also necessary         when marking to model
          50
"10          supervisory authorities expect  following valuation adjustments/reserves to be          formally considered at a minimum"
 unearned credit spreads
 close-out costs
          operational risks
 early termination
 investing and funding costs
 and future          administrative costs and
 where appropriate
 model risk
              faq          faq1       should valuation adjustments be performed on a portfolio level 
ie                     adjustments to be made in  form of a reserve for a portfolio of                     exposures and not to be reflected in  valuation of  individual                     transactions
 or on a transaction level 
ie adjustments to be reflected in                      valuation of  individual transactions
?                       supervisors expect   valuation adjustment will be considered for                     positions individually
        adjustment to  current valuation of less liquid positions for  regulatory capital purposes  50
11 banks must establish and maintain procedures for judging  necessity of and        calculating an adjustment to  current valuation of less liquid positions for        regulatory capital purposes
 this adjustment may be in addition to any changes        to  value of  position required for financial reporting purposes and should        be designed to reflect  illiquidity of  position
 supervisory authorities        expect banks to consider  need for an adjustment to a positions valuation to        reflect current illiquidity wher  position is marked to market using market        prices or observable inputs
 third-party valuations or marked to model
          50
12 bearing in mind   assumptions made about liquidity in  market risk        capital requirement may not be consistent with  banks ability to sell or hedge        out less liquid positions
 where appropriate
 banks must take an adjustment to         current valuation of se positions
 and review ir continued        appropriateness on an on-going basis
 reduced liquidity may have arisen from        market events
 additionally
" close-out prices for concentrated positions and/or        stale positions should be considered in establishing  adjustment"
 banks must        consider all relevant factors when determining  appropriateness of         adjustment for less liquid positions
 these factors may include
 but are not limited        to
"  amount of time it would take to hedge out  position/risks within         position"
"  average volatility of bid/offer spreads"
  availability of        independent market quotes 
number and identity of market-makers
""
  average        and volatility of trading volumes 
including trading volumes during periods of        market stress
""
 market concentrations
  ageing of positions
  extent to         which valuation relies on marking-to-model
 and  impact of or model risks         not included in cap50
11
    50
13 for complex products including
 but not limited to
 securitisation exposures and        n-th-to-default credit derivatives
 banks must explicitly assess  need for        valuation adjustments to reflect two forms of model risk
  model risk        associated with using a possibly incorrect valuation methodology
 and  risk        associated with using unobservable 
and possibly incorrect
 calibration        parameters in  valuation model
    50
14 the adjustment to  current valuation of less liquid positions made under        cap50
12 must impact tier 1 regulatory capital and may exceed those valuation        adjustments made under financial reporting standards and cap50

      transitional arrangements for expected credit loss accounting  90

ecl
 accounting
 jurisdictions applying a         transitional arrangement must implement such an arrangement as follows
    90
8   the transitional arrangement must apply only to provisions  are new under         an ecl accounting model
 new provisions are provisions which do not exist         under accounting approaches applied prior to  adoption of an ecl accounting         model
    90
9   the transitional arrangement must adjust common equity tier 1 capital
 where         re is a reduction in common equity tier 1 capital due to new provisions
 net of         tax effect
 upon adoption of an ecl accounting model
  decline in common         equity tier 1 capital 
 transitional adjustment amount
 must be partially         included 
ie added back
 to common equity tier 1 capital over a number of years         
 transition period
 commencing on  effective date of  transition to         ecl accounting
    90
10 jurisdictions must choose wher banks under ir supervision determine         transitional adjustment amount throughout  transition period by eir
                 
1
 calculating it just once
 at  effective date of  transition to ecl             accounting 
ie static approach

 or           
2
 recalculating it periodically to reflect  evolution of a banks ecl provisions             within  transition period 
ie dynamic approach
""
    90
11 the transitional adjustment amount may be calculated based on  impact on        common equity tier 1 capital upon adoption of an ecl accounting model or        from accounting provisions disclosed before and after  adoption of an ecl        accounting model
    90
12 for internal ratings-based 
irb
 portfolios
  calculation of transitional        adjustment amounts must take account of  shortfall of  stock of provisions        to expected losses
 as set out in cap30
13
 in some circumstances
 an increase in        provisions will not be fully reflected in irb common equity tier 1 capital
    90
13 the transition period commences from  date upon which a bank adopts ecl        accounting in a jurisdiction  requires or permits  implementation of an ecl        accounting framework
 the transition period must be no more than five years
    90
14 during  transition period
  transitional adjustment amount will be partially        included in 
ie added back to
 common equity tier 1 capital
 a fraction of         transitional adjustment amount 
based on  number of years in  transition        period
 will be included in common equity tier 1 capital during  first year of         transition period
 with  proportion included in common equity tier 1        capital phased out each year reafter during  course of  transition period        on a straight line basis
 the impact of ecl provisions on common equity tier 1        capital must not be fully neutralised during  transition period
    90
15 the transitional adjustment amount included in common equity tier 1 capital        each year during  transition period must be taken through to or measures        of capital as appropriate 
eg tier 1 capital and total capital
""
 and hence to         calculation of  leverage ratio and of large exposures limits
    90
16 jurisdictions must choose between applying  consequential adjustments listed        below or a simpler approach to ensure  banks do not receive inappropriate        capital relief
 
an example of a simpler approach  would not provide        inappropriate capital relief would be amortising  transitional arrangement        more rapidly than orwise
""
           
1
 account should be taken of tax effects in calculating  impact of ecl             accounting on common equity tier 1 capital
                 
2
 any deferred tax asset 
dta
 arising from a temporary difference associated             with a non-deducted provision amount must be disregarded for regulatory             purposes during  transitional period
 this means  such dta amount             must not be considered for common equity tier 1 capital
 and in return must             not be subject to deduction from common equity tier 1 capital and must             not be subject to risk weighting
 as applicable
           
3
 an accounting provision amount not deducted from common equity tier 1             capital should not
               
a
 be included in tier 2 capital
 even if  provision meets  definition of                 general or excess provisions
               
b
 reduce exposure amounts in  standardised approach even if it meets                  definition of a specific provision
 or               
c
   reduce  total exposure measure in  leverage ratio
    90
17 jurisdictions must publish details of any transitional arrangement applied
         rationale for it
 and its implications for supervision of banks 
eg wher        supervisory decisions will be based solely on regulatory metrics which        incorporate  effect of  transitional arrangement

tlac
         instruments or those of or financial entities
 even if y do not have direct         holdings
 more specifically
 se paragraphs require banks to capture  loss          a bank would suffer if  capital or tlac instrument is permanently written         off
 and subject this potential loss to  same treatment as a direct exposure
         this section defines indirect and syntic holdings and provides examples
    99
9   an indirect holding arises when a bank invests in an unconsolidated intermediate         entity  has an exposure to  capital of an unconsolidated bank
 financial or         insurance entity and thus gains an exposure to  capital of  financial         institution
    99
10 a syntic holding arises when a bank invests in an instrument where  value        of  instrument is directly linked to  value of  capital of an        unconsolidated bank
 financial or insurance entity
    99
11 set out below are some examples of indirect and syntic holdings to help        illustrate this treatment
           
1
 the bank has an investment in  capital of an entity  is not             consolidated for regulatory purposes and is aware  this entity has an             investment in  capital of a financial institution
           
2
 the bank enters into a total return swap on capital instruments of anor             financial institution
           
3
 the bank provides a guarantee or credit protection to a third party in respect             of  third partys investments in  capital of anor financial institution
           
4
 the bank owns a call option or has written a put option on  capital             instruments of anor financial institution
           
5
 the bank has entered into a forward purchase agreement on  capital of             anor financial institution
                 faq         faq1        what would be  prudential treatment applicable to a financial                     instrument where a bank commits itself to buy newly issued shares of                     an insurance company for a given amount should certain events occur?                     for example
 consider  following case
 bank a enters into a contract                     with firm b 
an insurance company
""
 the contract stipulates 
 if                     any of  three events defined below occurs within  next three                     years
 bank a must buy for 10 million new shares of firm b 
leading                     to a capital increase for firm b
""
 the new shares are generally issued                     with a discount 
eg 5%
 on  average market price recorded on                      trading days following  event
 in such a case
 bank a has to provide                      cash to firm b within a predefined timeline 
eg 10 days
""
 event 1
                     firm b incurs a technical loss above a threshold 
eg 1m
 for a specific                     event 
eg natural catastrophe
""
 event 2
 the loss ratio of a given line of                     business is higher than 120% for two consecutive semesters
 event 3
                     the share price of firm b falls below a given value
 bank a is not                     allowed to sell  financial instrument resulting from this contract to                     or entities

 these instruments must be                     deducted following a corresponding deduction approach

 the transaction                     described above has to be regarded as a derivative instrument 
in this                     case
 a put option
  has a capital instrument 
a share
 of a financial                     sector entity as its underlying
 hence
 it should be regarded as a                     syntic holding to be deducted from common equity tier 1 as per                      applicable deduction rules
      99

16 the committee recognises  floors based on  1988 accord will become        increasingly impractical to implement over time and refore believes         supervisors should have  flexibility to develop appropriate bank-by-bank        floors
 subject to full disclosure of  nature of  floors adopted
" such floors        may be based on  approach  bank was using before adoption of  irb        approach and/or ama"

17 one possible alternative floor
 for banks not migrating directly to an irb        approach or ama from rules based on  1988 accord
 is to calculate  floor        based on  non-modelling approach used prior to migration to  irb        approach or ama
 the prior non-modelling approach must be updated to reflect         prevailing basel capital standards in force at  time of  floor calculation

1   this chapter outlines  operation of  capital conservation buffer
 which is         designed to ensure  banks build up capital buffers outside periods of stress         which can be drawn down as losses are incurred
 the requirement is based on         simple capital conservation rules designed to avoid breaches of minimum capital         requirements

 the constraints         imposed only relate to distributions

      30
3   the distribution constraints imposed on banks when ir capital levels fall into          range increase as  banks capital levels approach  minimum         requirements
 by design
  constraints imposed on banks with capital levels at          top of  range would be minimal
 this reflects an expectation  banks         capital levels will from time to time fall into this range
 the basel committee does         not wish to impose constraints for entering  range  would be so restrictive         as to result in  range being viewed as establishing a new minimum capital         requirement
          30
4   the table below shows  minimum capital conservation ratios a bank must         meet at various levels of cet1 capital ratios
 the applicable conservation         standards must be recalculated at each distribution date
 for example
 a bank         with a cet1 capital ratio in  range of 5
125% to 5
75% is required to conserve         80% of its earnings in  subsequent payment period 
ie pay out no more than         20% in terms of dividends
 share buybacks and discretionary bonus payments
""
 if          bank wants to make payments in excess of  constraints imposed by this         regime
 it would have  option of raising capital in  private sector equal to          amount above  constraint which it wishes to distribute
 this would be         discussed with  banks supervisor as part of  capital planning process
 the         cet1 ratio includes amounts used to meet  4
5% minimum cet1 requirement
         but excludes any additional cet1 needed to meet  6% tier 1 and 8% total         capital requirements
 and also excludes any cet1 needed to meet  total loss

 requirement
 for example
 a bank with 8% cet1 and         no additional tier 1 or tier 2 capital
  has 10% of non-regulatory-capital tlac         instruments
 would meet its minimum risk-based capital and risk-based tlac         requirements
 but would have a zero conservation buffer and refore be         subject to  100% constraint on capital distributions

                      it should be noted  basel standards constitute minimum                    requirements and jurisdictions may decide to apply a more                    conservative treatment
      30
5   set out below are a number of or key aspects of  requirements
               
1
 elements subject to  restriction on distributions
 items considered to be           distributions include dividends and share buybacks
 discretionary payments           on or tier 1 capital instruments and discretionary bonus payments to           staff
 payments  do not result in a depletion of cet1
 which may for           example include certain scrip dividends
 are not considered distributions
 the           distribution restrictions do not apply to dividends which satisfy all three of            following conditions
             
a
  dividends cannot legally be cancelled by  bank
             
b
  dividends have already been removed from cet1
 and             
c
    dividends were declared in line with  applicable capital                 conservation standards 
as set out in rbc30
4
 at  time of declaration
         
2
 definition of earnings
 earnings are defined as distributable profits calculated           prior to  deduction of elements subject to  restriction on distributions
           earnings are calculated after  tax which would have been reported had           none of  distributable items been paid
 as such
 any tax impact of making           such distributions are reversed out
 where a bank does not have positive           earnings and has a cet1 ratio less than 7% 
or higher if  capital           conservation buffer has been expanded by or buffers
""
 it would be           restricted from making positive net distributions
         
3
 solo or consolidated application
 the framework should be applied at            consolidated level
 ie restrictions would be imposed on distributions out of            consolidated group
 national supervisors would have  option of           applying  regime at  solo level to conserve resources in specific parts           of  group
         
4
 additional supervisory discretion
 although  buffer must be capable of           being drawn down
 banks should not choose in normal times to operate in            buffer range simply to compete with or banks and win market share
           to ensure  this does not happen
 supervisors have  additional           discretion to impose time limits on banks operating within  buffer range           on a case-by-case basis
 in any case
 supervisors should ensure             capital plans of banks seek to rebuild buffers over an appropriate timeframe
          countercyclical buffer  30
6   losses incurred in  banking sector can be extremely large when a downturn is         preceded by a period of excess credit growth
 these losses can destabilise          banking sector and spark a vicious circle
 whereby problems in  financial         system can contribute to a downturn in  real economy  n feeds back on         to  banking sector
 these interactions highlight  particular importance of          banking sector building up additional capital defences in periods where          risks of system-wide stress are growing markedly
    30
7   the countercyclical buffer aims to ensure  banking sector capital         requirements take account of  macro-financial environment in which banks         operate
 it will be deployed by national jurisdictions when excess aggregate         credit growth is judged to be associated with a build-up of system-wide risk to         ensure  banking system has a buffer of capital to protect it against future         potential losses
 this focus on excess aggregate credit growth means          jurisdictions are likely to only need to deploy  buffer on an infrequent basis
         the buffer for internationally-active banks will be a weighted average of          buffers deployed across all  jurisdictions to which it has credit exposures
 this         means  y will likely find mselves subject to a small buffer on a more         frequent basis
 since credit cycles are not always highly correlated across         jurisdictions
    30
8   the countercyclical buffer regime consists of  following elements
           
1
 national authorities will monitor credit growth and or indicators  may             signal a build up of system-wide risk and make assessments of wher             credit growth is excessive and is leading to  build up of system-wide risk
             based on this assessment y will put in place a countercyclical buffer             requirement when circumstances warrant
 this requirement will be released             when system-wide risk crystallises or dissipates
           
2
 internationally active banks will look at  geographic location of ir             private sector credit exposures and calculate ir bank specific             countercyclical capital buffer requirement as a weighted average of              requirements  are being applied in jurisdictions to which y have credit             exposures
           
3
 the countercyclical buffer requirement to which a bank is subject will extend              size of  capital conservation buffer
 banks will be subject to             restrictions on distributions if y do not meet  requirement
          national countercyclical buffer requirements  30
9   each basel committee member jurisdiction will identify an authority with          responsibility to make decisions on  size of  countercyclical capital buffer
 if          relevant national authority judges a period of excess credit growth to be         leading to  build up of system-wide risk
 y will consider
 toger with any         or macroprudential tools at ir disposal
 putting in place a countercyclical         buffer requirement
 this will vary between zero and 2
5% of risk weighted assets
         depending on ir judgement as to  extent of  build up of system-wide         risk
     national authorities can implement a range of additional                     macroprudential tools
 including a buffer in excess of 2
5% for banks in                     ir jurisdiction
 if this is deemed appropriate in ir national context
                     however
  international reciprocity provisions set out in this regime                     treat  maximum countercyclical buffer as 2
5%
      30
10 the document entitled  guidance for national authorities operating         countercyclical capital buffer 
 sets out  principles  national authorities        have agreed to follow in making buffer decisions
 this document provides        information  should help banks to understand and anticipate  buffer        decisions made by national authorities in  jurisdictions to which y have        credit exposures
    30
11 to give banks time to adjust to a buffer level
 a jurisdiction will pre-announce its        decision to raise  level of  countercyclical buffer by up to 12 months
        decisions by a jurisdiction to decrease  level of  countercyclical buffer will        take effect immediately
 the pre-announced buffer decisions and  actual        buffers in place for all committee member jurisdictions will be published on         bank for international settlements

         banks outside of this jurisdiction with credit exposures to                   counterparties in this jurisdiction will also be subject to  increased                   buffer level after  pre-announcement period in respect of se                   exposures
 however
 in cases where  pre-announcement period of a                   jurisdiction is shorter than 12 months
  home authority of such                   banks should seek to match  preannouncement period where                   practical

 banks
 and                    general public?                     authorities need to communicate all buffer decisions

 authorities are                   free to choose  communication vehicles y see as most                   appropriate for ir jurisdiction
 authorities are not formally required                   to publish a given set of information regarding ir countercyclical                   capital buffer regime and policy decisions
 however
 as noted in                   guidance for national authorities operating  countercyclical capital                   buffer
 since  credit-to-gdp guide should be considered as a useful                   starting reference point
 re is a need to disclose  guide on a                   regular basis
         faq2        how often are authorities expected to communicate buffer decisions?                   do y need to communicate a decision to leave a previously                   announced countercyclical capital buffer rate unchanged?                     authorities should communicate buffer decisions at least annually
 this                   includes  case where re is no change in  prevailing buffer rate
                     more frequent communications should be made
 however
 to explain                 buffer actions when y are taken
         faq3      how much time do banks have to build up  capital buffer add-on?                 are re differences between decisions by home and host supervisors?                   the time period between  policy announcement date and                  effective date for any increase in  countercyclical buffer is to give                 banks time to meet  additional capital requirements before y                 take effect
 this time period should be up to 12 months
 ie if deemed                 necessary by  host supervisor
  effective date may be accelerated                 to less than 12 months following  policy announcement date
                   under jurisdictional reciprocity
 home authorities should seek to ensure                 ir banks meet any accelerated timeline where practical
 and in any                 case
 subject to a maximum of 12 months following  host                 jurisdictions policy announcement date
 finally
 banks have discretion                 to meet  buffer sooner
         faq4      when re has been a decrease in  buffer rate
 how quickly can                 banks use  portion of  buffer  has been released?                   under basel iii

 banks in                 or jurisdictions may also use  buffer immediately once  host                 authority reduces  buffer rate for credit exposures to its jurisdiction
                 notwithstanding this
 home and subsidiary regulators could prohibit                 capital distributions if y considered it imprudent under                  circumstances

 the buffer should be based on  latest relevant        jurisdictional countercyclical buffers  are available at  date  y        calculate ir minimum capital requirement
      capital conservation best practice  30
20 outside of periods of stress
 banks should hold buffers of capital above         regulatory minimum
 implementation of  buffers in this chapter will help        increase sector resilience going into a downturn
 and provide  mechanism for        rebuilding capital during  early stages of economic recovery
 retaining a        greater proportion of earnings during a downturn will help ensure  capital        remains available to support  ongoing business operations of banks through         period of stress
    30
21 when buffers have been drawn down
 one way banks should look to rebuild        m is through reducing discretionary distributions of earnings
 this could        include reducing dividend payments
 share-backs and staff bonus payments
        banks may also choose to raise new capital from  private sector as an        alternative to conserving internally generated capital
 the balance between se        options should be discussed with supervisors as part of  capital planning        process
          30
22 greater efforts should be made to rebuild buffers  more y have been        depleted
 therefore
 in  absence of raising capital in  private sector
          share of earnings retained by banks for  purpose of rebuilding ir capital         buffers should increase  nearer ir actual capital levels are to  minimum         capital requirement
    30
23 it is not acceptable for banks which have depleted ir capital buffers to use        future predictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous        distributions to shareholders
 or capital providers and employees
 these        stakeholders
 rar than depositors
 must bear  risk  recovery will not be        forthcoming
 it is also not acceptable for banks which have depleted ir capital        buffers to try and use  distribution of capital as a way to signal ir financial        strength
 not only is this irresponsible from  perspective of an individual bank
        putting shareholders interests above depositors
 it may also encourage or        banks to follow suit
 as a consequence
 banks in aggregate can end up increasing        distributions at  exact point in time when y should be conserving earnings

1   the aim of  higher loss absorbency requirement
 as set out in  report         endorsed by  group of twenty at its seoul summit in november 2010
 is to         ensure  global systemically important financial institutions have a higher         share of ir balance sheets funded by instruments which increase  resilience         of  institution as a going-concern
 taking into account this going-concern         objective
 global systemically important banks

 until it has completed  plan and returned to         compliance
 it is subject to  limitations on dividend payout defined by          conservation buffer bands

 although  bucket thresholds is set initially such          bucket 5 is empty
 if this bucket should become populated in  future
 a new         bucket will be added to maintain incentives for banks to avoid becoming more         systemically important
 each new bucket will be equal in size 
in terms of scores
         to each of  initially populated buckets and  minimum higher loss         absorbency requirement for  new buckets will increase in increments of 1% of         risk-weighted assets

         it will be required to meet  additional requirement within a time frame of 12         months
 after this grace period
 if  bank does not meet  higher loss         absorbency requirement
  capital retention mechanism for  expanded         capital conservation buffer will be applied

          higher loss absorbency for domestic systemically important banks  40

 a domestic systemically important bank 
d-sib
         framework is best understood as taking  complementary perspective to  g
        sib regime by focusing on  impact   distress or failure of banks         
including by international banks
 will have on  domestic economy
 the         principles developed by  committee for d-sibs would allow for appropriate         national discretion to accommodate structural characteristics of  domestic         financial system
 including  possibility for countries to go beyond          minimum d-sib framework and impose additional requirements based on          specific features of  country and its domestic banking sector
    40
8   the principles set out below focus on  higher loss absorbency requirement for         d-sibs
 the committee would like to emphasise  or policy tools
         particularly more intensive supervision
 can also play an important role in dealing         with d-sibs
           
1
 national authorities should document  methodologies and considerations             used to calibrate  level of higher loss absorbency   framework             would require for d-sibs in ir jurisdiction
 the level of higher loss             absorbency calibrated for d-sibs should be informed by quantitative             methodologies 
where available
 and country-specific factors without             prejudice to  use of supervisory judgement

 the higher loss absorbency requirement imposed on a bank should be             commensurate with  degree of systemic importance
 as identified under             sco50

 including cases in             which a d-sib higher loss absorbency requirement is applied at              subsidiary level
 home authorities should impose  higher of eir  d

4
 in cases where  subsidiary of a bank is considered to be a d-sib by a host             authority
 home and host authorities should make arrangements to                   coordinate and cooperate on  appropriate higher loss absorbency             requirement
 within  constraints imposed by relevant laws in  host             jurisdiction
           
5
 the higher loss absorbency requirement should be met fully by common             equity tier 1
 in addition
 national authorities should put in place any             additional requirements and or policy measures y consider to be             appropriate to address  risks posed by a d-sib
      principle 1
 documenting methodologies for calibration  40
9   the purpose of a higher loss absorbency requirement for d-sibs is to reduce         furr  probability of failure compared to non-systemic institutions
 reflecting          greater impact a d-sib failure is expected to have on  domestic financial         system and economy
    40
10 it is important for  application of a d-sib higher loss absorbency
 at both         parent and subsidiary level
 to be based on a transparent and well articulated        assessment framework to ensure  implications of  requirements are well        understood by both  home and  host authorities
    40
11 the level of higher loss absorbency for d-sibs should be subject to policy        judgement by national authorities
 that said
 re needs to be some form of        analytical framework  would inform policy judgements
 this was  case for         policy judgement made by  committee on  level of  additional loss        absorbency requirement for g-sibs
    40
12 the policy judgement on  level of higher loss absorbency requirements should        also be guided by country-specific factors which could include  degree of        concentration in  banking sector or  size of  banking sector relative to        gross domestic product 
gdp
""
 specifically
 countries  have a larger banking        sector relative to gdp are more likely to suffer larger direct economic impacts of         failure of a d-sib than those with smaller banking sectors
 while size-to-gdp        is easy to calculate
  concentration of  banking sector could also be        considered 
as a failure in a medium-sized highly concentrated banking sector        would likely create more of an impact on  domestic economy than if it were to        occur in a larger
 more widely dispersed banking sector
""
                           anor factor  could be relevant is  funding position of                      banking sector
 whereby more foreign wholesale funding could                     increase  transition costs 
deleveraging
 facing both  financial                     sector and  domestic economy in  event of a crisis
      40
13 the use of se factors in calibrating  higher loss absorbency requirement        would provide justification for different intensities of policy responses across        countries for banks  are orwise similar across  four key bank-specific        factors outlined in sco50
14 to sco50
17
      principle 2
 calibration commensurate with systemic importance  40
14 although  d-sib framework does not produce scores based on a prescribed        methodology as in  case of  g-sib framework
  higher loss absorbency        requirements for d-sibs should also be decided based on  degree of domestic        systemic importance
 this is to provide  appropriate incentives to banks which        are subject to  higher loss absorbency requirements to reduce 
or at least not        increase
 ir systemic importance over time
 in  case where re are        multiple d-sib buckets in a jurisdiction
 this could imply differentiated levels of        higher loss absorbency between d-sib buckets
      principle 3
 consistency between application of g-sib and d-sib  frameworks  40
15 national authorities
 including host authorities
 currently have  capacity to set        and impose capital requirements y consider appropriate to banks within ir        jurisdictions
 sco40
5 states  host authorities of g-sib subsidiaries may apply        an additional loss absorbency requirement at  individual legal entity or        consolidated level within ir jurisdiction
 an imposition of a d-sib higher loss        absorbency by a host authority is no different 
except for additional transparency
        from ir current capacity to impose a pillar 1 or 2 capital charge
 therefore
         ability of  host authorities to implement a d-sib higher loss absorbency on        local subsidiaries does not raise any new home-host issues
          40
16 national authorities should ensure  banks with  same degree of systemic        importance in ir jurisdiction
 regardless of wher y are domestic banks
        subsidiaries of foreign banking groups
 or subsidiaries of g-sibs
 are subject to         same higher loss absorbency requirements
 ceteris paribus
 banks in a        jurisdiction should be subject to a consistent
 coherent and non-discriminatory        treatment regardless of  ownership
 the objective of  host authorities        power to impose higher loss absorbency on subsidiaries is to bolster capital to           mitigate  potential heightened impact of  subsidiaries failure on          domestic economy due to ir systemic nature
 this should be maintained in         cases where a bank might not be 
or might be less
 systemic at home
 but its         subsidiary is 
more
 systemic in  host jurisdiction
    40
17 an action by  host authorities to impose a d-sib higher loss absorbency        requirement leads to increases in capital at  subsidiary level which can be        viewed as a shift in capital from  parent bank to  subsidiary
 unless it        already holds an adequate capital buffer in  host jurisdiction or  additional        capital raised by  subsidiary is from outside investors
 this could
 in  case of        substantial or large subsidiaries
 materially decrease  level of capital protecting         parent bank
 under such cases
 it is important   home authority        continues to ensure re are sufficient financial resources at  parent level
 for        example through a solo capital requirement

    40
18 within a jurisdiction
 applying  d-sib framework to both g-sibs and non-g
       sibs will help ensure a level playing field within  national context
 for example
        in a jurisdiction with two banks  are roughly identical in terms of ir        assessed systemic nature at  domestic level
 but where one is a g-sib and         or is not
 national authorities would have  capacity to apply  same d-sib        higher loss absorbency requirement to both
 in such cases
  home authorities        could face a situation where  higher loss absorbency requirement on         consolidated group will be  higher of those prescribed by  g-sib and d-sib        frameworks 
ie  higher of eir  d-sib or g-sib requirement
""
    40
19 double-counting should be avoided
 the higher loss absorbency requirements        derived from  g-sib and d-sib frameworks should not be additive
 this will        ensure  overall consistency between  two frameworks and allows  d-sib        framework to take  complementary perspective to  g-sib framework
          principle 4
 home and host cooperation  40
20 the committee recognises  re could be some concern  host        authorities tend not to have a group-wide perspective when applying higher loss        absorbency requirements to subsidiaries of foreign banking groups in ir        jurisdiction
 the home authorities
 on  or hand
 clearly need to know d-sib        higher loss absorbency requirements on significant subsidiaries since re could        be implications for  allocation of financial resources within  banking group
    40
21 in se circumstances
 it is important  arrangements to coordinate and        cooperate on  appropriate higher loss absorbency requirement between home        and host authorities are established and maintained
 within  constraints        imposed by relevant laws in  host jurisdiction
 when formulating higher loss        absorbency requirements
 this is particularly important to make it possible for         home authority to test  capital position of a parent on a stand-alone basis        as mentioned in rbc40
16 and to prevent a situation where  home authorities        are surprised by  action of  host authorities
 home and host authorities        should coordinate and cooperate with each or on any plan to impose a higher        loss absorbency requirement on a subsidiary bank
 and  amount of         requirement
 before taking any action
 the host authority should provide a        rationale for ir decision
" and an indication of  steps  bank would need to        take to avoid/reduce such a requirement"
 the home and host authorities should        also discuss
           
1
  resolution regimes 
including recovery and resolution plans
 in both             jurisdictions
           
2
 available resolution strategies and any specific resolution plan in place for              firm
 and           
3
  extent to which such arrangements should influence higher loss             absorbency requirements
          principle 5
 higher loss absorbency requirement met with common  equity tier 1 and additional requirements and policy measures to  address  risks posed by a d-sib  40
22 higher loss absorbency requirements for d-sibs should be fully met with        common equity tier 1 to ensure a maximum degree of consistency with g-sibs in        terms of effective loss-absorbing capacity
 this has  benefit of facilitating        direct and transparent comparability of  application of requirements across        jurisdictions
 an element  is considered desirable given  fact  most of        se banks will have cross-border operations being in direct competition with        each or
 in addition
 national authorities should put in place any additional        requirements and or policy measures y consider to be appropriate to        address  risks posed by a d-sib
    40
23 national authorities should implement  higher loss absorbency requirement        through an extension of  capital conservation buffer
 maintaining  division        of  buffer into four bands of equal size 
as described in rbc30
17
""
 this is in        line with  treatment of  additional loss absorbency requirement for g-sibs
        the higher loss absorbency requirement for d-sibs is essentially a requirement         sits on top of  capital buffers and minimum capital requirement
 with a        pre-determined set of consequences for banks  do not meet this requirement

 the first is  standardised approach

1
 the standardised approach assigns standardised risk weights to exposures as             described in this chapter
 cre20
 risk weighted assets are calculated as              product of  standardised risk weights and  exposure amount
             exposures should be risk-weighted net of specific provisions 
including             partial write-offs

 banks may use assessments by external credit assessment             institutions  are recognised as eligible for capital purposes by national             supervisors
 the requirements covering  use of external ratings are set out             in chapter cre21
           
3
 the credit risk mitigation techniques  are permitted to be recognised             under  standardised approach are set out in chapter cre22

 the use of s&p credit ratings is an example only
                     those of some or external credit assessment institutions could                     equally well be used
 the ratings used throughout this document

        claims on banks  20
11 there are two options for claims on banks
 national supervisors will apply one        option to all banks in ir jurisdiction
 no claim on an unrated bank
 except for        self-liquidating letters of credit
 may receive a risk weight lower than  applied        to claims on its sovereign of incorporation
    20
12 under  first option
 all banks incorporated in a given country will be assigned        a risk weight one category less favourable than  assigned to claims on         sovereign of  country
 however
 for claims on banks in countries with        sovereigns rated bb
 to b
and on banks in unrated countries  risk weight will        be capped at 100%
    20
13 the second option bases  risk weighting on  external credit assessment of         bank itself with claims on unrated banks being risk-weighted at 50%
 under        this option
 a preferential risk weight  is one category more favourable may        be applied to claims with an original maturity of three months or less
 subject to        a floor of 20%
 this treatment will be available to both rated and unrated banks
        but not to banks risk weighted at 150%
    supervisors should ensure  claims with 
contractual
 original                     maturity under 3 months which are expected to be rolled over 
ie                     where  effective maturity is longer than 3 months
 do not qualify for                     this preferential treatment for capital adequacy purposes
      20

 it can also assign

 a risk weight  is one category less favourable than         assigned to claims on  sovereign
 subject to a floor of 20%

      claims on securities firms  20
16 claims on securities firms may be treated as claims on banks provided se firms        are subject to supervisory and regulatory arrangements comparable to those        under this framework 
including
 in particular
 risk-based capital requirements
""
        orwise such claims would follow  rules for claims on corporates
           that is
 capital requirements  are comparable to those applied to                        banks in this framework

18 supervisory authorities should increase  standard risk weight for unrated        claims where y judge  a higher risk weight is warranted by  overall        default experience in ir jurisdiction
 as part of  supervisory review process
        supervisors may also consider wher  credit quality of corporate claims held        by individual banks should warrant a standard risk weight higher than 100%
    20
19 at national discretion
 supervisory authorities may permit banks to risk weight all        corporate claims at 100% without regard to external ratings
 where this        discretion is exercised by  supervisor
 it must ensure  banks apply a single        consistent approach
 ie eir to use ratings wherever available or not at all
 to        prevent cherry-picking of external ratings
 banks should obtain supervisory        approval before utilising this option to risk weight all corporate claims at 100%

1
 orientation criterion
 the exposure is to an individual person or persons or             to a small business
           
2
 product criterion
 the exposure takes  form of any of  following
             revolving credits and lines of credit 
including credit cards and overdrafts
""
             personal term loans and leases 
eg instalment loans
 auto loans and leases

 and small business facilities             and commitments
 securities 
such as bonds and equities
""
 wher listed or             not
 are specifically excluded from this category

see cre20
23
""
           
3
 granularity criterion
 the supervisor must be satisfied   regulatory             retail portfolio is sufficiently diversified to a degree  reduces  risks in              portfolio
 warranting  75% risk weight
 one way of achieving this may             be to set a numerical limit  no aggregate exposure to one counterpart             can exceed 0
2% of  overall regulatory retail portfolio
           
4
 low value of individual exposures
 the maximum aggregated retail exposure             to one counterpart cannot exceed an absolute threshold of 1 million
      aggregated exposure means gross amount 
ie not taking any credit risk                     mitigation into account
 of all forms of debt exposures 
eg loans or                     commitments
  individually satisfy  three or criteria
 in                     addition
 to one counterpart means one or several entities  may                     be considered as a single beneficiary 
eg in  case of a small business                      is affiliated to anor small business
  limit would apply to                      banks aggregated exposure on both businesses

      claims secured by commercial real estate  20
25 in view of  experience in numerous countries  commercial property        lending has been a recurring cause of troubled assets in  banking industry        over  past few decades
  committee holds to  view  mortgages on        commercial real estate do not
 in principle
 justify or than a 100% weighting of         loans secured
            the committee
 however
 recognises 
 in exceptional circumstances                     for well-developed and long-established markets
" mortgages on office                     and/or multi-purpose commercial premises and/or multi-tenanted                     commercial premises may have  potential to receive a preferential                     risk weight of 50% for  tranche of  loan  does not exceed                      lower of 50% of  market value or 60% of  mortgage lending                     value of  property securing  loan"
 any exposure beyond se                     limits will receive a 100% risk weight
 this exceptional treatment will                     be subject to very strict conditions

                                      external credit assessment    the recognition process    21
1   national supervisors are responsible for determining on a continuous basis         wher an external credit assessment institution 
ecai
 meets  criteria listed         in  paragraph below
 national supervisors should refer to  international         organization of securities commissions 
iosco
 code of conduct fundamentals         for credit rating agencies when determining ecai eligibility
 the assessments of         ecais may be recognised on a limited basis
 eg by type of claims or by         jurisdiction
 the supervisory process for recognising ecais should be made public         to avoid unnecessary barriers to entry
      eligibility criteria    21
2   an ecai must satisfy each of  following six criteria
           
1
 objectivity
 the methodology for assigning credit assessments must be             rigorous
 systematic
 and subject to some form of validation based on             historical experience
 moreover
 assessments must be subject to ongoing             review and responsive to changes in financial condition
 before being             recognised by supervisors
 an assessment methodology for each market             segment
 including rigorous backtesting
 must have been established for at             least one year and preferably three years
           
2
 independence
 an ecai should be independent and should not be subject to             political or economic pressures  may influence  rating
 the             assessment process should be as free as possible from any constraints              could arise in situations where  composition of  board of directors or              shareholder structure of  assessment institution may be seen as             creating a conflict of interest
           
3
" international access/transparency"
 the individual assessments
  key             elements underlining  assessments and wher  issuer participated in              assessment process should be publicly available on a non-selective basis
             unless y are private assessments
 in addition
  general procedures
             methodologies and assumptions for arriving at assessments used by              ecai should be publicly available
                 
4
 disclosure
 an ecai should disclose  following information
 its code of             conduct
  general nature of its compensation arrangements with assessed             entities
 its assessment methodologies
 including  definition of default
              time horizon
 and  meaning of each rating
  actual default rates             experienced in each assessment category
 and  transitions of              assessments
 eg  likelihood of aa ratings becoming a over time
           
5
 resources
 an ecai should have sufficient resources to carry out high quality             credit assessments
 these resources should allow for substantial ongoing             contact with senior and operational levels within  entities assessed in             order to add value to  credit assessments
 such assessments should be             based on methodologies combining qualitative and quantitative approaches
           
6
 credibility
 to some extent
 credibility is derived from  criteria above
 in             addition
  reliance on an ecais external credit assessments by             independent parties 
investors
 insurers
 trading partners
 is evidence of              credibility of  assessments of an ecai
 the credibility of an ecai is also             underpinned by  existence of internal procedures to prevent  misuse             of confidential information
 in order to be eligible for recognition
 an ecai             does not have to assess firms in more than one country
      implementation considerations    the mapping process    21
3   supervisors will be responsible for assigning eligible ecais assessments to          risk weights available under  standardised risk weighting framework
 ie         deciding which assessment categories correspond to which risk weights
 the         mapping process should be objective and should result in a risk weight         assignment consistent with  of  level of credit risk reflected in  tables         above
 it should cover  full spectrum of risk weights
    21
4   when conducting such a mapping process
 factors  supervisors should assess         include
 among ors
  size and scope of  pool of issuers  each ecai         covers
  range and meaning of  assessments  it assigns
 and          definition of default used by  ecai
 in order to promote a more consistent         mapping of assessments into  available risk weights and help supervisors in         conducting such a process
 standardised approach 
implementing  mapping         process 
april 2019
 provides guidance as to how such a mapping process may be         conducted
          21
5               banks must use  chosen ecais and ir ratings consistently for each type of         claim
 for both risk weighting and risk management purposes
 banks will not be         allowed to cherry-pick  assessments provided by different ecais and to         arbitrarily change  use of ecais
      multiple assessments    21
6   if re is only one assessment by an ecai chosen by a bank for a particular claim
          assessment should be used to determine  risk weight of  claim
    21
7   if re are two assessments by ecais chosen by a bank which map into different         risk weights
  higher risk weight will be applied
    21
8   if re are three or more assessments with different risk weights
          assessments corresponding to  two lowest risk weights should be referred to         and  higher of those two risk weights will be applied
      issuer versus issues assessment    21
9   where a bank invests in a particular issue  has an issue-specific assessment
          risk weight of  claim will be based on this assessment
 where  banks         claim is not an investment in a specific assessed issue
  following general         principles apply
           
1
 in circumstances where  borrower has a specific assessment for an issued             debt  but  banks claim is not an investment in this particular debt  a             high quality credit assessment 
one which maps into a risk weight lower than              which applies to an unrated claim
 on  specific debt may only be             applied to  banks unassessed claim if this claim ranks pari passu or senior             to  claim with an assessment in all respects
 if not
  credit assessment             cannot be used and  unassessed claim will receive  risk weight for             unrated claims
                 
2
 in circumstances where  borrower has an issuer assessment
 this             assessment typically applies to senior unsecured claims on  issuer
             consequently
 only senior claims on  issuer will benefit from a high             quality issuer assessment
 or unassessed claims of a highly assessed             issuer will be treated as unrated
 if eir  issuer or a single issue has a             low quality assessment 
mapping into a risk weight equal to or higher than              which applies to unrated claims
""
 an unassessed claim on  same             counterparty  ranks pari passu or is subordinated to eir  senior                unsecured issuer assessment or  exposure assessment will be assigned               same risk weight as is applicable to  low quality assessment
    21
10 wher  bank intends to rely on an issuer
or an issue-specific assessment
         assessment must take into account and reflect  entire amount of credit risk        exposure  bank has with regard to all payments owed to it
 for example
 if a        bank is owed both principal and interest
  assessment must fully take into        account and reflect  credit risk associated with repayment of both principal        and interest
    21
11 in order to avoid any double counting of credit enhancement factors
 no        supervisory recognition of credit risk mitigation techniques will be taken into        account if  credit enhancement is already reflected in  issue specific rating

1   banks use a number of techniques to mitigate  credit risks to which y are         exposed
 for example
 exposures may be collateralised by first priority claims
 in         whole or in part with cash or securities
 a loan exposure may be guaranteed by a         third party
 or a bank may buy a credit derivative to offset various forms of credit         risk

      overview of credit risk mitigation techniques    collateralised transactions 
 introduction    22
10 a collateralised transaction is one in which
           
1
 banks have a credit exposure or potential credit exposure
 and           
2
  credit exposure or potential credit exposure is hedged in whole or in             part by collateral posted by a counterparty or by a third party on behalf of              counterparty
      in this section counterparty is used to denote a party to whom a bank                     has an on
or off-balance sheet credit exposure or a potential credit                     exposure
 that exposure may
 for example
 take  form of a loan of                     cash or securities 
where  counterparty would traditionally be called                      borrower

12 banks may opt for eir  simple approach
 which substitutes  risk        weighting of  collateral for  risk weighting of  counterparty for         collateralised portion of  exposure 
generally subject to a 20% floor
""
 or for         comprehensive approach
 which allows a more precise offset of collateral against        exposures
 by effectively reducing  exposure amount by  value ascribed to         collateral
 banks may operate under eir
 but not both
 approaches in         banking book
 but only under  comprehensive approach in  trading book
        partial collateralisation is recognised in both approaches
 mismatches in         maturity of  underlying exposure and  collateral will only be allowed under         comprehensive approach
    22
13 however
 before capital relief will be granted in respect of any form of collateral
         standards set out below in cre22
14 to cre22
17 must be met under eir        approach
    22
14 in addition to  general requirements for legal certainty set out in cre22
9
         legal mechanism by which collateral is pledged or transferred must ensure          bank has  right to liquidate or take legal possession of it
 in a timely        manner
 in  event of  default
 insolvency or bankruptcy 
or one or more        orwise-defined credit events set out in  transaction documentation
 of         counterparty 
and
 where applicable
 of  custodian holding  collateral
""
        furrmore banks must take all steps necessary to fulfil those requirements        under  law applicable to  banks interest in  collateral for obtaining and        maintaining an enforceable security interest
 eg by registering it with a registrar
        or for exercising a right to net or set off in relation to title transfer collateral
          22
15 in order for collateral to provide protection
  credit quality of  counterparty        and  value of  collateral must not have a material positive correlation
 for         example
 securities issued by  counterparty  or by any related group entity          would provide little protection and so would be ineligible
    22
16 banks must have clear and robust procedures for  timely liquidation of        collateral to ensure  any legal conditions required for declaring  default of         counterparty and liquidating  collateral are observed
 and  collateral        can be liquidated promptly
    22
17 where  collateral is held by a custodian
 banks must take reasonable steps to        ensure   custodian segregates  collateral from its own assets
    22
18 a capital requirement will be applied to a bank on eir side of  collateralised        transaction
 for example
 both repos and reverse repos will be subject to capital        requirements
 likewise
 both sides of a securities lending and borrowing        transaction will be subject to explicit capital charges
 as will  posting of        securities in connection with a derivative exposure or or borrowing
    22
19 where a bank
 acting as an agent
 arranges a repo-style transaction 
"ie repurchase        /reverse repurchase and securities lending/borrowing transactions"
 between a        customer and a third party and provides a guarantee to  customer          third party will perform on its obligations
 n  risk to  bank is  same as        if  bank had entered into  transaction as a principal
 in such circumstances
        a bank will be required to calculate capital requirements as if it were itself         principal

      collateralised transactions
 overall framework and minimum conditions under   comprehensive approach          22
21 in  comprehensive approach
 when taking collateral
 banks will need to        calculate ir adjusted exposure to a counterparty for capital adequacy purposes        in order to take account of  effects of  collateral
 using haircuts
 banks are        required to adjust both  amount of  exposure to  counterparty and         value of any collateral received in support of  counterparty to take account of        possible future fluctuations in  value of eir
 occasioned by market         movements
 this will produce volatility-adjusted amounts for both exposure and         collateral
 unless eir side of  transaction is cash
  volatility-adjusted         amount for  exposure will be higher than  exposure and for  collateral it         will be lower
        exposure amounts may vary where
 for example
 securities are being                     lent
      22
22 additionally where  exposure and collateral are held in different currencies an        additional downwards adjustment must be made to  volatility-adjusted        collateral amount to take account of possible future fluctuations in exchange        rates
    22
23 where  volatility-adjusted exposure amount is greater than  volatility
       adjusted collateral amount 
including any furr adjustment for foreign        exchange risk
""
 banks shall calculate ir risk-weighted assets as  difference        between  two multiplied by  risk weight of  counterparty
 the        framework for performing se calculations is set out in cre22
40 to cre22
43
    22
24 in principle
 banks have two ways of calculating  haircuts
 
i
 standard        supervisory haircuts
 using parameters set by  committee
 and 
ii
 own
       estimate haircuts
 using banks own internal estimates of market price volatility
        supervisors will allow banks to use own-estimate haircuts only when y fulfil        certain qualitative and quantitative criteria
    22
25 a bank may choose to use standard or own-estimate haircuts independently of         choice it has made between  standardised approach and  foundation        irb approach to credit risk
 however
 if banks seek to use ir own-estimate        haircuts
 y must do so for  full range of instrument types for which y        would be eligible to use own-estimates
  exception being immaterial portfolios        where y may use  standard supervisory haircuts
          22
26 the size of  haircuts  banks must use depends on  prescribed holding        period for  transaction
 the holding period is  period of time over which        exposure or collateral values are assumed to move before  bank can close out         transaction
 banks  use own-estimate haircuts must eir use            supervisory prescribed minimum holding period
 or must scale-up or scale-down         ir estimated haircuts if y have used a holding period  is different to          supervisory prescribed minimum
 the supervisory prescribed minimum holding         period is used as  basis for  calculation of  standard supervisory         haircuts
    22
27 the holding period
 and thus  size of  individual haircuts
 will depend on         type of instrument
 type of transaction and  frequency of marking-to
       market and remargining
 for example
 repo-style transactions subject to daily        marking-to-market and to daily remargining will receive a haircut based on a 5
       business day holding period and secured lending transactions with daily mark-to
       market and no remargining clauses will receive a haircut based on a 20-business        day holding period
 these haircut numbers will be scaled up using  square        root of time formula depending on  actual frequency of remargining or        marking-to-market
    22
28 for certain types of repo-style transactions 
broadly speaking government bond        repos as defined in cre22
66 and cre22
67
 supervisors may allow banks using        standard supervisory haircuts or own-estimate haircuts not to apply se in        calculating  exposure amount after risk mitigation
    22
29 the effect of master netting agreements covering repo-style transactions can be        recognised for  calculation of capital requirements subject to  conditions in        cre22
69
 where repo-style transactions are subject to a master netting        agreement wher y are held in  banking book or trading book
 a bank        may choose not to recognise  netting effects in calculating capital
 in         case
 each transaction will be subject to a capital charge as if re were no        master netting agreement
    22
30 as a furr alternative to standard supervisory haircuts and own-estimate        haircuts banks may use value-at-risk 
var
 models for calculating potential price        volatility for repo-style transactions and or similar securities financing        transactions

 explicit
 irrevocable and        unconditional
 and supervisors are satisfied  banks fulfil certain minimum        operational conditions relating to risk management processes y may allow        banks to take account of such credit protection in calculating capital        requirements
    22
33 a range of guarantors and protection providers are recognised
 and a        substitution approach will be applied
 thus only guarantees issued by or        protection provided by entities with a lower risk weight than  counterparty will        lead to reduced capital charges since  protected portion of  counterparty        exposure is assigned  risk weight of  guarantor or protection provider
        whereas  uncovered portion retains  risk weight of  underlying        counterparty

 if a netting set        includes both repo-style and or capital market transactions
  minimum          holding period of ten business days must be used

 a higher        minimum holding period must be used in  following cases
          
1
 for all netting sets where  number of trades exceeds 5000 at any point            during a quarter
 a 20 business day minimum holding period for             following quarter must be used
          
2
 for netting sets containing one or more trades involving illiquid collateral
 a            minimum holding period of 20 business days must be used
 illiquid            collateral must be determined in  context of stressed market conditions            and will be characterised by  absence of continuously active markets            where a counterparty would
 within two or fewer days
 obtain multiple price            quotations  would not move  market or represent a price reflecting a            market discount
 examples of situations where trades are deemed illiquid for            this purpose include
 but are not limited to
 trades  are not marked daily            and trades  are subject to specific accounting treatment for valuation            purposes

2 can separately        apply for supervisory recognition to use ir internal var models for calculation        of potential price volatility for repo-style transactions
 internal models will only be        accepted when a bank can prove  quality of its model to  supervisor        through  backtesting of its output using one year of historical data

 this                     determination must not be  sole responsibility of  protection                     seller
"  protection buyer must have  right/ability to inform                      protection provider of  occurrence of a credit event"
 given                      recently developed market practice of  big bang protocol
 which all                     in  credit derivatives industry have signed
 how does this protocol                     affect  recognition of credit derivatives?                       credit derivatives under  big bang protocol can still be recognised
                     cre22
86 is still satisfied by
 
1
"  protection buyer having  right                     /ability to request a ruling from  determinations committee"
 so                      buyer is not powerless
 and 
2
  determinations committee being                     independent of  protection seller
 this means   roles and                     identities are clearly defined in  protocol
 and  determination of                     a credit event is not  sole responsibility of  protection seller

        risk-weight treatment of transactions in which eligible credit protection is provided    22
91 the general risk-weight treatment for transactions in which eligible credit        protection is provided is as follows
                 
1
 the protected portion is assigned  risk weight of  protection provider
             the uncovered portion of  exposure is assigned  risk weight of              underlying counterparty
           
2
 materiality thresholds on payments below which no payment is made in              event of loss are equivalent to retained first loss positions and must be             deducted in full from  capital of  bank purchasing  credit protection
    22
92 where  amount guaranteed
 or against which credit protection is held
 is less        than  amount of  exposure
 and  secured and unsecured portions are of        equal seniority
 ie  bank and  guarantor share losses on a pro-rata basis
        capital relief will be afforded on a proportional basis
 that is
"  protected        portion of  exposure will receive  treatment applicable to eligible        guarantees/credit derivatives"
 with  remainder treated as unsecured
    22
93 where  bank transfers a portion of  risk of an exposure in one or more        tranches to a protection seller or sellers and retains some level of risk of  loan        and  risk transferred and  risk retained are of different seniority
 banks may        obtain credit protection for eir  senior tranches 
eg second loss portion
 or         junior tranche 
eg first loss portion
""
 in this case  rules as set out in         securitisation chapters of  credit risk standard will apply
      currency mismatches    22
94 where  credit protection is denominated in a currency different from  in        which  exposure is denominated  ie re is a currency mismatch          amount of  exposure deemed to be protected will be reduced by         application of a haircut hfx
 using  formula  follows
 where
           
1
 g is nominal amount of  credit protection           
2
 hfx is haircut appropriate for currency mismatch between  credit             protection and underlying obligation          22
95 the appropriate haircut based on a 10-business day holding period 
assuming        daily marking-to-market
 will be applied in  calculation of  formula in         paragraph above
 if a bank uses  supervisory haircuts it will be 8%
 the        haircuts must be scaled up using  square root of time formula
 depending on         frequency of revaluation of  credit protection as described in cre22
63        and cre22
65
          sovereign guarantees and counter-guarantees    22
96 as specified in cre20
5
 a lower risk weight may be applied at national discretion        to a banks exposures to  sovereign 
or central bank
 where  bank is        incorporated and where  exposure is denominated in domestic currency and        funded in  currency
 national authorities may extend this treatment to        portions of claims guaranteed by  sovereign 
or central bank
""
 where         guarantee is denominated in  domestic currency and  exposure is funded        in  currency
 a claim may be covered by a guarantee  is indirectly counter
       guaranteed by a sovereign
 such a claim may be treated as covered by a        sovereign guarantee provided 
           
1
  sovereign counter-guarantee covers all credit risk elements of  claim
           
2
 both  original guarantee and  counter-guarantee meet all operational             requirements for guarantees
 except   counter-guarantee need not be             direct and explicit to  original claim
 and           
3
  supervisor is satisfied   cover is robust and  no historical             evidence suggests   coverage of  counter-guarantee is less than             effectively equivalent to  of a direct sovereign guarantee
      maturity mismatches  22
97 for  purposes of calculating risk-weighted assets
 a maturity mismatch occurs        when  residual maturity of a hedge is less than  of  underlying        exposure
      definition of maturity          22
98 the maturity of  underlying exposure and  maturity of  hedge should        both be defined conservatively
 the effective maturity of  underlying should        be gauged as  longest possible remaining time before  counterparty is        scheduled to fulfil its obligation
 taking into account any applicable grace period
        for  hedge
 embedded options which may reduce  term of  hedge        should be taken into account so   shortest possible effective maturity is        used
 where a call is at  discretion of  protection seller
  maturity will        always be at  first call date
 if  call is at  discretion of  protection        buying bank but  terms of  arrangement at origination of  hedge        contain a positive incentive for  bank to call  transaction before contractual        maturity
  remaining time to  first call date will be deemed to be         effective maturity
 for example
 where re is a step-up in cost in conjunction        with a call feature or where  effective cost of cover increases over time even if        credit quality remains  same or increases
  effective maturity will be         remaining time to  first call
      risk weights for maturity mismatches    22
99 as outlined in cre22
35
 hedges with maturity mismatches are only recognised        when ir original maturities are greater than or equal to one year
 as a result
         maturity of hedges for exposures with original maturities of less than one        year must be matched to be recognised
 in all cases
 hedges with maturity        mismatches will no longer be recognised when y have a residual maturity of        three months or less
    22
100when re is a maturity mismatch with recognised credit risk mitigants        
collateral
 on-balance sheet netting
 guarantees and credit derivatives
         following adjustment applies
 where
           
1
 pa is value of  credit protection adjusted for maturity mismatch           
2
 p is credit protection 
eg collateral amount

101in  case where a bank has multiple crm techniques covering a single exposure        
eg a bank has both collateral and guarantee partially covering an exposure
""
         bank will be required to subdivide  exposure into portions covered by each        type of crm technique 
eg portion covered by collateral
 portion covered by        guarantee
 and  risk-weighted assets of each portion must be calculated        separately
 when credit protection provided by a single protection provider has        differing maturities
 y must be subdivided into separate protection as well
      first-to-default credit derivatives    22
102there are cases where a bank obtains credit protection for a basket of reference        names and where  first default among  reference names triggers  credit        protection and  credit event also terminates  contract
 in this case
  bank        may recognise regulatory capital relief for  asset within  basket with         lowest risk-weighted amount
 but only if  notional amount is less than or        equal to  notional amount of  credit derivative
    22
103with regard to  bank providing credit protection through such an instrument
         risk weights of  assets included in  basket will be aggregated up to a        maximum of 1250% and multiplied by  nominal amount of  protection        provided by  credit derivative to obtain  risk-weighted asset amount
      second-to-default credit derivatives    22
104in  case where  second default among  assets within  basket triggers         credit protection
  bank obtaining credit protection through such a        product will only be able to recognise any capital relief if first-default-protection        has also be obtained or when one of  assets within  basket has already        defaulted
    22
105for banks providing credit protection through such a product
  capital        treatment is  same as in cre22
103 above with one exception
 the exception is        
 in aggregating  risk weights
  asset with  lowest risk weighted        amount can be excluded from  calculation

1   this chapter describes  internal ratings-based 
irb
 approach for credit risk
         subject to certain minimum conditions and disclosure requirements
 banks          have received supervisory approval to use  irb approach may rely on ir         own internal estimates of risk components in determining  capital requirement         for a given exposure
 the risk components include measures of  probability of         default 
pd
""
 loss given default 
lgd
""
  exposure at default 
ead
""
 and effective         maturity 
m

 in some cases
 banks may be required to use a supervisory value as         opposed to an internal estimate for one or more of  risk components
    30
2   the irb approach is based on measures of unexpected losses 
ul
 and expected         losses
 the risk-weight functions
 as outlined in cre31
 produce capital         requirements for  ul portion
 expected losses are treated separately
 as         outlined in cre35

 re is a         description of  risk components to be used by banks by asset class
 third
          requirements  relate to a banks adoption of  irb approach at  asset         class level and  related roll-out requirements are outlined
 in cases where an         irb treatment is not specified
  risk weight for those or exposures is 100%
         except when a 0% risk weight applies under  standardised approach

 what risk weight                     should apply?                       yes
  rou asset should be included in rwa
 the intent of                      revisions to  lease accounting standards was to more appropriately                     reflect  economics of leasing transactions
 including both                      lessee  obligation to make future lease payments
 as well as an rou                     asset reflecting  lessee  control over  leased item  economic                     benefits during  lease term
 the rou asset should be risk-weighted                     at 100%

5   under  irb approach

 within  corporate asset class
 five sub-classes of         specialised lending are separately identified
 within  retail asset class
 three         sub-classes are separately identified
 within  corporate and retail asset classes
         a distinct treatment for purchased receivables may also apply provided certain         conditions are met
          30
6   the classification of exposures in this way is broadly consistent with established         bank practice
 however
 some banks may use different definitions in ir internal         risk management and measurement systems
 while it is not  intention of          committee to require banks to change  way in which y manage ir         business and risks
 banks are required to apply  appropriate treatment to each         exposure for  purposes of deriving ir minimum capital requirement
 banks           must demonstrate to supervisors  ir methodology for assigning exposures         to different classes is appropriate and consistent over time
      definition of corporate exposures  30
7   in general

 the exposure is typically to an entity 
often a special purpose entity

"             which was created specifically to finance and/or operate physical assets"
           
2
 the borrowing entity has little or no or material assets or activities

hvcre
""
 each of se sub-classes is defined below
      project finance          30
10 pf is a method of funding in which  lender looks primarily to  revenues        generated by a single project
 both as  source of repayment and as security        for  exposure
 this type of financing is usually for large
 complex and        expensive installations  might include
 for example
 power plants
 chemical        processing plants
 mines
 transportation infrastructure
 environment
 and         telecommunications infrastructure
 project finance may take  form of financing         of  construction of a new capital installation
 or refinancing of an existing         installation
 with or without improvements
    30
11 in such transactions
  lender is usually paid solely or almost exclusively out of         money generated by  contracts for  facilitys output
 such as         electricity sold by a power plant
 the borrower is usually an spe  is not        permitted to perform any function or than developing
 owning
 and operating         installation
 the consequence is  repayment depends primarily on         projects cash flow and on  collateral value of  projects assets
 in contrast
        if repayment of  exposure depends primarily on a well-established
 diversified
        credit-worthy
 contractually obligated end user for repayment
 it is considered a        secured exposure to  end-user
      object finance    30
12 of refers to a method of funding  acquisition of physical assets 
eg ships
        aircraft
 satellites
 railcars
 and fleets
 where  repayment of  exposure is        dependent on  cash flows generated by  specific assets  have been        financed and pledged or assigned to  lender
 a primary source of se cash        flows might be rental or lease contracts with one or several third parties
 in        contrast
 if  exposure is to a borrower whose financial condition and debt
       servicing capacity enables it to repay  debt without undue reliance on         specifically pledged assets
  exposure should be treated as a collateralised        corporate exposure
      commodities finance    30
13 cf refers to structured short-term lending to finance reserves
 inventories
 or        receivables of exchange-traded commodities 
eg crude oil
 metals
 or crops
""
        where  exposure will be repaid from  proceeds of  sale of         commodity and  borrower has no independent capacity to repay         exposure
 this is  case when  borrower has no or activities and no or        material assets on its balance sheet
 the structured nature of  financing is        designed to compensate for  weak credit quality of  borrower
 the        exposures rating reflects its self-liquidating nature and  lenders skill in        structuring  transaction rar than  credit quality of  borrower
          30
14 the committee believes  such lending can be distinguished from exposures        financing  reserves

15 ipre refers to a method of providing funding to real estate 
such as
 office        buildings to let

 and hotels
 where  prospects for repayment and recovery        on  exposure depend primarily on  cash flows generated by  asset

20 an exposure is categorised as a retail exposure if it meets all of  criteria set out        in cre30
21 
which relate to  nature of  borrower and value of individual        exposures
 and all of  criteria set out in cre30
22 
which relate to  size of         pool of exposures
""
    30
21 the criteria related to  nature of  borrower and value of  individual        exposures are as follows
                 
1
 exposures to individuals  such as revolving credits and lines of credit 
eg             credit cards
 overdrafts
 and retail facilities secured by financial instruments
             as well as personal term loans and leases 
eg instalment loans
 auto loans             and leases
 student and educational loans
 personal finance
 and or             exposures with similar characteristics
  are generally eligible for retail             treatment regardless of exposure size
 although supervisors may wish to             establish exposure thresholds to distinguish between retail and corporate             exposures
           
2
 residential mortgage loans 
including first and subsequent liens
 term loans             and revolving home equity lines of credit
 are eligible for retail treatment             regardless of exposure size so long as  credit is extended to an individual              is an owner-occupier of  property 
with  understanding              supervisors exercise reasonable flexibility regarding buildings containing             only a few rental units orwise y are treated as corporate
""
 loans             secured by a single or small number of condominium or co-operative             residential housing units in a single building or complex also fall within              scope of  residential mortgage category
 national supervisors may set             limits on  maximum number of housing units per exposure
           
3
 loans extended to small businesses and managed as retail exposures are             eligible for retail treatment provided  total exposure of  banking group             to a small business borrower 
on a consolidated basis where applicable
 is             less than 1 million
 small business loans extended through or guaranteed             by an individual are subject to  same exposure threshold
           
4
 it is expected  supervisors provide flexibility in  practical application of             such thresholds such  banks are not forced to develop extensive new             information systems simply for  purpose of ensuring perfect compliance
             it is
 however
 important for supervisors to ensure  such flexibility 
and              implied acceptance of exposure amounts in excess of  thresholds              are not treated as violations
 is not being abused
    30
22 the criteria related to  size of  pool of exposures are as follows
           
1
 the exposure must be one of a large pool of exposures
 which are managed             by  bank on a pooled basis
                 
2
 small business exposures below 1 million may be treated as retail             exposures if  bank treats such exposures in its internal risk management             systems consistently over time and in  same manner as or retail             exposures
 this requires  such an exposure be originated in a similar             manner to or retail exposures
 furrmore
 it must not be managed             individually in a way comparable to corporate exposures
 but rar as part             of a portfolio segment or pool of exposures with similar risk characteristics                for purposes of risk assessment and quantification
 however
 this does not              preclude retail exposures from being treated individually at some stages of               risk management process
 the fact  an exposure is rated individually              does not by itself deny  eligibility as a retail exposure
    30
23 within  retail asset class category
 banks are required to identify separately        three sub-classes of exposures
           
1
 exposures secured by residential properties as defined above
           
2
 qualifying revolving retail exposures
 as defined in  following paragraph
             and           
3
 all or retail exposures
      definition of qualifying revolving retail exposures    30
24 all of  following criteria must be satisfied for a sub-portfolio to be treated as a        qualifying revolving retail exposure 
qrre
""
 these criteria must be applied at a        sub-portfolio level consistent with  banks segmentation of its retail activities        generally
 segmentation at  national or country level 
or below
 should be         general rule
           
1
 the exposures are revolving
 unsecured
 and uncommitted 
both             contractually and in practice
""
 in this context
 revolving exposures are defined             as those where customers outstanding balances are permitted to fluctuate             based on ir decisions to borrow and repay
 up to a limit established by              bank
           
2
 the exposures are to individuals
           
3
 the maximum exposure to a single individual in  sub-portfolio is             100
000 or less
                
4
 because  asset correlation assumptions for  qrre risk-weight function            are markedly below those for  or retail risk-weight function at low pd            values
 banks must demonstrate   use of  qrre risk-weight            function is constrained to portfolios  have exhibited low volatility of loss             rates
 relative to ir average level of loss rates
 especially within  low pd             bands
 supervisors will review  relative volatility of loss rates across              qrre subportfolios
 as well as  aggregate qrre portfolio
 and intend to             share information on  typical characteristics of qrre loss rates across             jurisdictions
          
5
 data on loss rates for  sub-portfolio must be retained in order to allow            analysis of  volatility of loss rates
          
6
 the supervisor must concur  treatment as a qualifying revolving retail            exposure is consistent with  underlying risk characteristics of  sub
           portfolio
      definition of equity exposures  30
25 in general
 equity exposures are defined on  basis of  economic substance        of  instrument
 they include both direct and indirect ownership interests
        wher voting or non-voting
 in  assets and income of a commercial        enterprise or of a financial institution  is not consolidated or deducted        pursuant to cap30
 an instrument is considered to be an equity exposure if it        meets all of  following requirements
          
1
 it is irredeemable in  sense   return of invested funds can be            achieved only by  sale of  investment or sale of  rights to             investment or by  liquidation of  issuer
          
2
 it does not embody an obligation on  part of  issuer
 and          
3
 it conveys a residual claim on  assets or income of  issuer
              indirect equity interests include holdings of derivative instruments tied                     to equity interests
 and holdings in corporations
 partnerships
 limited                     liability companies or or types of enterprises  issue ownership                     interests and are engaged principally in  business of investing in                     equity instruments
          where some member countries retain ir existing treatment as an                     exception to  deduction approach
 such equity investments by irb                     banks are to be considered eligible for inclusion in ir irb equity                     portfolios
      30
26 additionally any of  following instruments must be categorised as an equity        exposure
          
1
 an instrument with  same structure as those permitted as tier 1 capital            for banking organisations
          
2
 an instrument  embodies an obligation on  part of  issuer and            meets any of  following conditions
               
a
 the issuer may defer indefinitely  settlement of  obligation
               
b
 the obligation requires 
or permits at  issuers discretion
 settlement                 by issuance of a fixed number of  issuers equity shares
               
c
   the obligation requires 
or permits at  issuers discretion
 settlement                   by issuance of a variable number of  issuers equity shares and                   
ceteris paribus
 any change in  value of  obligation is attributable                   to
 comparable to
 and in  same direction as
  change in  value                   of a fixed number of  issuers equity shares
 or
               
d
 the holder has  option to require   obligation be settled in                 equity shares
 unless eir 
i
 in  case of a traded instrument
                  supervisor is content   bank has demonstrated                   instrument trades more like  debt of  issuer than like its equity
 or                 
ii
 in  case of non-traded instruments
  supervisor is content                   bank has demonstrated   instrument should be treated as a                 debt position
 in cases 
i
 and 
ii
""
  bank may decompose  risks for                 regulatory purposes
 with  consent of  supervisor
             for certain obligations  require or permit settlement by issuance of                     a variable number of  issuers equity shares
  change in                      monetary value of  obligation is equal to  change in  fair                     value of a fixed number of equity shares multiplied by a specified                     factor
 those obligations meet  conditions of item 3 if both                      factor and  referenced number of shares are fixed
 for example
 an                     issuer may be required to settle an obligation by issuing shares with a                     value equal to three times  appreciation in  fair value of 1
000                     equity shares
 that obligation is considered to be  same as an                     obligation  requires settlement by issuance of shares equal to                      appreciation in  fair value of 3
000 equity shares
      30
27 debt obligations and or securities
 partnerships
 derivatives or or vehicles        structured with  intent of conveying  economic substance of equity        ownership are considered an equity holding
 this includes liabilities from which         return is linked to  of equities
 conversely
 equity investments  are        structured with  intent of conveying  economic substance of debt holdings        or securitisation exposures would not be considered an equity holding
"    equities  are recorded as a loan but arise from a debt/equity swap                     made as part of  orderly realisation or restructuring of  debt are                     included in  definition of equity holdings"
 however
 se                     instruments may not attract a lower capital charge than would apply if                      holdings remained in  debt portfolio
     supervisors may decide not to require  such liabilities be included                     where y are directly hedged by an equity holding
 such   net                     position does not involve material risk
      30
28 the national supervisor has  discretion to re-characterise debt holdings as        equities for regulatory purposes and to orwise ensure  proper treatment of        holdings under  supervisory review process standard srp
      definition of eligible purchased receivables  30
29 eligible purchased receivables are divided into retail and corporate receivables as        defined below
          retail receivables    30
30 purchased retail receivables
 provided  purchasing bank complies with  irb        rules for retail exposures
 are eligible for  top-down approach as permitted        within  existing standards for retail exposures
 the bank must also apply         minimum operational requirements as set forth in cre34 and cre36
      corporate receivables    30
31 in general
 for purchased corporate receivables
 banks are expected to assess         default risk of individual obligors as specified in cre31 
starting with cre31
3
        consistent with  treatment of or corporate exposures
 however
  top
       down approach may be used
 provided   purchasing banks programme        for corporate receivables complies with both  criteria for eligible receivables        and  minimum operational requirements of this approach
 the use of  top
       down purchased receivables treatment is limited to situations where it would be        an undue burden on a bank to be subjected to  minimum requirements for         irb approach to corporate exposures  would orwise apply
 primarily
 it        is intended for receivables  are purchased for inclusion in asset-backed        securitisation structures
 but banks may also use this approach
 with  approval        of national supervisors
 for appropriate on-balance sheet exposures  share         same features
    30
32 supervisors may deny  use of  top-down approach for purchased corporate        receivables depending on  banks compliance with minimum requirements
 in        particular
 to be eligible for  proposed top-down treatment
 purchased        corporate receivables must satisfy  following conditions
           
1
 the receivables are purchased from unrelated
 third party sellers
 and as such              bank has not originated  receivables eir directly or indirectly
           
2
 the receivables must be generated on an arms-length basis between              seller and  obligor
 
as such
 intercompany accounts receivable and             receivables subject to contra-accounts between firms  buy and sell to             each or are ineligible
""
           
3
 the purchasing bank has a claim on all proceeds from  pool of             receivables or a pro-rata interest in  proceeds
                 
4
 national supervisors must also establish concentration limits above which             capital charges must be calculated using  minimum requirements for              bottom-up approach for corporate exposures
 such concentration limits may             refer to one or a combination of  following measures
  size of one               individual exposure relative to  total pool
  size of  pool of             receivables as a percentage of regulatory capital
 or  maximum size of an             individual exposure in  pool
          contra-accounts involve a customer buying from and selling to                      same firm
 the risk is  debts may be settled through payments in                     kind rar than cash
 invoices between  companies may be offset                     against each or instead of being paid
 this practice can defeat a                     security interest when challenged in court

 would fall under  securitisation treatment
      30
33 the existence of full or partial recourse to  seller does not automatically        disqualify a bank from adopting this top-down approach
 as long as  cash        flows from  purchased corporate receivables are  primary protection        against default risk as determined by  rules in cre34
4 to cre34
7 for        purchased receivables and  bank meets  eligibility criteria and operational        requirements
      foundation and advanced approaches  30
34 for each of  asset classes covered under  irb framework
 re are three        key elements
           
1
 risk components
 estimates of risk parameters provided by banks some of             which are supervisory estimates
           
2
 risk-weight functions
  means by which risk components are transformed             into risk-weighted assets and refore capital requirements
           
3
 minimum requirements
  minimum standards  must be met in order             for a bank to use  irb approach for a given asset class
          30
35 for many of  asset classes
  committee has made available two broad        approaches
 a foundation and an advanced approach
 under  foundation        approach
 as a general rule
 banks provide ir own estimates of pd and rely on           supervisory estimates for or risk components
 under  advanced approach
         banks provide more of ir own estimates of pd
 lgd and ead
 and ir own         calculation of m
 subject to meeting minimum standards
 for both  foundation         and advanced approaches
 banks must always use  risk-weight functions         provided in this framework for  purpose of deriving capital requirements
 the         full suite of approaches is described below
      corporate
 sovereign and bank exposures  30
36 under  foundation approach
 banks must provide ir own estimates of pd        associated with each of ir borrower grades
 but must use supervisory        estimates for  or relevant risk components
 the or risk components are        lgd
 ead and m
       as noted in cre32
39
 some supervisors may require banks using                      foundation approach to calculate m using  definition provided in                     cre32
41 to cre32
49
      30
37 under  advanced approach
 banks must calculate  effective maturity 
m
        and provide ir own estimates of pd
 lgd and ead
     at  discretion of  national supervisor
 certain domestic exposures                     may be exempt from  calculation of m

 each of which is associated        with a specific risk weight
 this version is termed  supervisory slotting criteria        approach
    30
40 banks  meet  requirements for  estimation of pd are able to use         foundation approach to corporate exposures to derive risk weights for all classes        of sl exposures except hvcre

" data        limitations may mean  banks can meet  standards for  use of own        estimates of lgd and ead for some but not all of ir asset classes/business        units at  same time"
    30
47 as such
 supervisors may allow banks to adopt a phased rollout of  irb        approach across  banking group
 the phased rollout includes

 adoption of        irb across asset classes within  same business unit 
or in  case of retail        exposures across individual sub-classes

ii
 adoption of irb across business units        in  same banking group

 however
 when a bank adopts        an irb approach for an asset class within a particular business unit

""
 it must apply  irb approach to        all exposures within  asset class

48 a bank must produce an implementation plan
 specifying to what extent and        when it intends to roll out irb approaches across significant asset classes 
or sub
       classes in  case of retail
 and business units over time
 the plan should be        exacting
 yet realistic
 and must be agreed with  supervisor
 it should be driven        by  practicality and feasibility of moving to  more advanced approaches
        and not motivated by a desire to adopt an approach  minimises its capital        charge
 during  roll-out period
 supervisors will ensure  no capital relief is        granted for intra-group transactions which are designed to reduce a banking        groups aggregate capital charge by transferring credit risk among entities on         standardised approach

or sub
       classes in  case of retail

        subject to supervisory approval
 capital requirements for such operations will be        determined according to  standardised approach
 with  national supervisor        determining wher a bank should hold more capital under  supervisory        review process standard srp for such positions
          30
50 notwithstanding  above
 once a bank has adopted  irb approach for all or        part of any of  corporate
 bank
 sovereign
 or retail asset classes
 it will be         required to adopt  irb approach for its equity exposures at  same time
         subject to materiality
 supervisors may require a bank to employ one of  irb         equity approaches if its equity exposures are a significant part of  banks         business
 even though  bank may not employ an irb approach in or         business lines
 furr
 once a bank has adopted  general irb approach for         corporate exposures
 it will be required to adopt  irb approach for  sl sub
        classes within  corporate exposure class
    30
51 banks adopting an irb approach are expected to continue to employ an irb        approach
 a voluntary return to  standardised or foundation approach is        permitted only in extraordinary circumstances
 such as divestiture of a large        fraction of  banks credit-related business
 and must be approved by         supervisor
    30
52 given  data limitations associated with sl exposures
 a bank may remain on         supervisory slotting criteria approach for one or more of  pf
 of
 cf
 ipre        or hvcre sub-classes
 and move to  foundation or advanced approach for        or sub-classes within  corporate asset class
 however
 a bank should not        move to  advanced approach for  hvcre sub-class without also doing so        for material ipre exposures at  same time

        43 to cre31

 institutions are permitted to calculate         minimum capital requirements for ir banking book equity holdings using one        or both of two separate and distinct methods
 a simple risk weight method or an        internal models method
 the method used should be consistent with  amount        and complexity of  institutions equity holdings and commensurate with         overall size and sophistication of  institution
 supervisors may require  use        of eir method based on  individual circumstances of an institution
      market-based approach
 simple risk weight method    31
31 under  simple risk weight method
 a 300% risk weight is to be applied to        equity holdings  are publicly traded and a 400% risk weight is to be applied        to all or equity holdings
 a publicly traded holding is defined as any equity        security traded on a recognised security exchange

 or short         positions are to be treated as if y are long positions with  relevant risk         weight applied to  absolute value of each position
 in  context of maturity         mismatched positions
  methodology is  for corporate exposures
      market-based approach
 internal models method    31
33 irb banks may use
 or may be required by ir supervisor to use
 internal risk        measurement models to calculate  risk-based capital requirement
 under this        alternative
 banks must hold capital equal to  potential loss on  institutions        equity holdings as derived using internal value-at-risk models subject to  99th        percentile
 one-tailed confidence interval of  difference between quarterly        returns and an appropriate risk-free rate computed over a long-term sample        period
 the capital charge would be incorporated into an institutions risk-based        capital ratio through  calculation of risk-weighted equivalent assets
    31
34 the risk weight used to convert holdings into risk-weighted equivalent assets        would be calculated by multiplying  derived capital charge by 12
5 
ie         inverse of  minimum 8% risk-based capital requirement
""
 capital charges        calculated under  internal models method may be no less than  capital        charges  would be calculated under  simple risk weight method using a        200% risk weight for publicly traded equity holdings and a 300% risk weight for        all or equity holdings
 these minimum capital charges would be calculated        separately using  methodology of  simple risk weight approach

85 for guarantees
 for any recognition of double           default effects for both guarantees and credit derivatives a bank must have            right and expectation to receive payment from  credit protection           provider without having to take legal action in order to pursue            counterparty for payment
 to  extent possible
 a bank should take steps           to satisfy itself   protection provider is willing to pay promptly if a           credit event should occur
         
7
 the purchased credit protection absorbs all credit losses incurred on            hedged portion of an exposure  arise due to  credit events outlined in            contract

9
 the terms and conditions of credit protection arrangements must be legally           confirmed in writing by both  credit protection provider and  bank

 in  case of protection against dilution risk
  seller of purchased            receivables must not be a member of  same group as  protection            provider
         
11
 there is no excessive correlation between  creditworthiness of a            protection provider and  obligor of  underlying exposure due to ir            performance being dependent on common factors beyond  systematic            risk factor
 the bank has a process to detect such excessive correlation
 an            example of a situation in which such excessive correlation would arise is            when a protection provider guarantees  debt of a supplier of goods or            services and  supplier derives a high proportion of its income or revenue            from  protection provider

    32
34 the amount to which  ccf is applied is  lower of  value of  unused        committed credit line
 and  value  reflects any possible constraining        availability of  facility
 such as  existence of a ceiling on  potential        lending amount which is related to a borrowers reported cash flow
 if  facility        is constrained in this way

2   for receivables belonging unambiguously to one asset class
  irb risk weight         for default risk is based on  risk-weight function applicable to  particular         exposure type
 as long as  bank can meet  qualification standards for this         particular risk-weight function

 given  el estimate for  pools default losses
  risk weight for default             risk is determined by  risk-weight function for corporate exposures
 as             described below
  precise calculation of risk weights for default risk             depends on  banks ability to decompose el into its pd and lgd             components in a reliable manner
 banks can utilise external and internal data             to estimate pds and lgds

1
 if  purchasing bank is unable to decompose el into its pd and lgd            components in a reliable manner
  risk weight is determined from             corporate risk-weight function using  following specifications

 the focus is on banks abilities to rank order         and quantify risk in a consistent
 reliable and valid fashion
          36
4   the overarching principle behind se requirements is  rating and risk         estimation systems and processes provide for a meaningful assessment of         borrower and transaction characteristics
 a meaningful differentiation of risk
 and         reasonably accurate and consistent quantitative estimates of risk

            systems and processes must be consistent with internal use of se         estimates
 the committee recognises  differences in markets
 rating         methodologies
 banking products
 and practices require banks and supervisors to         customise ir operational procedures
 it is not  committees intention to         dictate  form or operational detail of banks risk management policies and         practices

7   to be eligible for an irb approach
 a bank must demonstrate to its supervisor          it meets  irb requirements in this document
 at  outset and on an         ongoing basis
 banks overall credit risk management practices must also be         consistent with  evolving sound practice guidelines issued by  committee         and national supervisors
          36
8         there may be circumstances when a bank is not in complete compliance with all          minimum requirements
 where this is  case
  bank must produce a plan         for a timely return to compliance
 and seek approval from its supervisor
 or          bank must demonstrate   effect of such non-compliance is immaterial in         terms of  risk posed to  institution
 failure to produce an acceptable plan         or satisfactorily implement  plan or to demonstrate immateriality will lead         supervisors to reconsider  banks eligibility for  irb approach

" a bank may utilise multiple rating methodologies        /systems"
 for example
 a bank may have customised rating systems for specific        industries or market segments 
eg middle market
 and large corporate
""
 if a bank        chooses to use multiple systems
  rationale for assigning a borrower to a        rating system must be documented and applied in a manner  best reflects         level of risk of  borrower
 banks must not allocate borrowers across rating        systems inappropriately to minimise regulatory capital requirements

      rating dimensions 
 standards for corporate
 sovereign
 and bank exposures    36
11 a qualifying irb rating system must have two separate and distinct dimensions
           
1
  risk of borrower default
 and           
2
 transaction-specific factors

12 the first dimension must be oriented to  risk of borrower default
 separate        exposures to  same borrower must be assigned to  same borrower grade
        irrespective of any differences in  nature of each specific transaction
 there are        two exceptions to this
 firstly
 in  case of country transfer risk
 where a bank        may assign different borrower grades depending on wher  facility is        denominated in local or foreign currency
 secondly
 when  treatment of         associated guarantees to a facility may be reflected in an adjusted borrower         grade
 in eir case
 separate exposures may result in multiple grades for          same borrower
 a bank must articulate in its credit policy  relationship         between borrower grades in terms of  level of risk each grade implies
         perceived and measured risk must increase as credit quality declines from one         grade to  next
 the policy must articulate  risk of each grade in terms of         both a description of  probability of default risk typical for borrowers assigned          grade and  criteria used to distinguish  level of credit risk
    36
13 the second dimension must reflect transaction-specific factors
 such as collateral
        seniority
 product type
 etc
 for foundation irb banks
 this requirement can be        fulfilled by  existence of a facility dimension
 which reflects both borrower and        transaction-specific factors
 for example
 a rating dimension  reflects        expected loss 
el
 by incorporating both borrower strength 
pd
 and loss severity        
lgd
 considerations would qualify
 likewise a rating system  exclusively        reflects lgd would qualify
 where a rating dimension reflects el and does not        separately quantify lgd
  supervisory estimates of lgd must be used
    36
14 for banks using  advanced approach
 facility ratings must reflect exclusively        lgd
 these ratings can reflect any and all factors  can influence lgd        including
 but not limited to
  type of collateral
 product
 industry
 and        purpose
 borrower characteristics may be included as lgd rating criteria only to         extent y are predictive of lgd
 banks may alter  factors  influence        facility grades across segments of  portfolio as long as y can satisfy ir        supervisor  it improves  relevance and precision of ir estimates
    36
15 banks using  supervisory slotting criteria for  sl sub-class are exempt from        this two-dimensional requirement for se exposures
" given         interdependence between borrower/transaction characteristics in sl"
 banks may        satisfy  requirements under this heading through a single rating dimension         reflects el by incorporating both borrower strength 
pd
 and loss severity        
lgd
 considerations
 this exemption does not apply to banks using eir         general corporate foundation or advanced approach for  sl sub-class
      rating dimensions
 standards for retail exposures          36
16 rating systems for retail exposures must be oriented to both borrower and        transaction risk
 and must capture all relevant borrower and transaction           characteristics
 banks must assign each exposure  falls within  definition of         retail for irb purposes into a particular pool
 banks must demonstrate  this         process provides for a meaningful differentiation of risk
 provides for a grouping         of sufficiently homogenous exposures
 and allows for accurate and consistent         estimation of loss characteristics at pool level
    36
17 for each pool
 banks must estimate pd
 lgd
 and ead
 multiple pools may share        identical pd
 lgd and ead estimates
 at a minimum
 banks should consider         following risk drivers when assigning exposures to a pool
           
1
 borrower risk characteristics 
eg borrower type
" demographics such as age             /occupation"

eg             loan to value measures
 seasoning

first vs
 second             lien

""
 banks must explicitly address crosscollateral provisions where present

 delinquency of exposure
 banks are expected to separately identify             exposures  are delinquent and those  are not
      rating structure 
 standards for corporate
 sovereign
 and bank exposures    36
18 a bank must have a meaningful distribution of exposures across grades with no        excessive concentrations
 on both its borrower-rating and its facility-rating scales
    36
19 to meet this objective
 a bank must have a minimum of seven borrower grades        for non-defaulted borrowers and one for those  have defaulted
 banks with        lending activities focused on a particular market segment may satisfy this        requirement with  minimum number of grades
    36
20 a borrower grade is defined as an assessment of borrower risk on  basis of a        specified and distinct set of rating criteria
 from which estimates of pd are        derived
 the grade definition must include both a description of  degree of        default risk typical for borrowers assigned  grade and  criteria used to        distinguish  level of credit risk
 furrmore
 
 or 
modifiers to alpha or        numeric grades will only qualify as distinct grades if  bank has developed        complete rating descriptions and criteria for ir assignment
 and separately        quantifies pds for se modified grades
          36
21 banks with loan portfolios concentrated in a particular market segment and range        of default risk must have enough grades within  range to avoid undue        concentrations of borrowers in particular grades
 significant concentrations        within a single grade or grades must be supported by convincing empirical         evidence   grade or grades cover reasonably narrow pd bands and           default risk posed by all borrowers in a grade fall within  band
    36
22 there is no specific minimum number of facility grades for banks using         advanced approach for estimating lgd
 a bank must have a sufficient number of        facility grades to avoid grouping facilities with widely varying lgds into a single        grade
 the criteria used to define facility grades must be grounded in empirical        evidence
    36
23 banks using  supervisory slotting criteria for  sl asset classes must have at        least four grades for non-defaulted borrowers
 and one for defaulted borrowers
        the requirements for sl exposures  qualify for  corporate foundation and        advanced approaches are  same as those for general corporate exposures
      rating structure
 standards for retail exposures    36
24 for each pool identified
  bank must be able to provide quantitative measures        of loss characteristics 
pd
 lgd
 and ead
 for  pool
 the level of differentiation        for irb purposes must ensure   number of exposures in a given pool is        sufficient so as to allow for meaningful quantification and validation of  loss        characteristics at  pool level
 there must be a meaningful distribution of        borrowers and exposures across pools
 a single pool must not include an undue        concentration of  banks total retail exposure
      rating criteria    36
25 a bank must have specific rating definitions
 processes and criteria for assigning        exposures to grades within a rating system
 the rating definitions and criteria        must be both plausible and intuitive and must result in a meaningful        differentiation of risk
           
1
 the grade descriptions and criteria must be sufficiently detailed to allow             those charged with assigning ratings to consistently assign  same grade             to borrowers or facilities posing similar risk
 this consistency should exist             across lines of business
 departments and geographic locations
 if rating             criteria and procedures differ for different types of borrowers or facilities
              bank must monitor for possible inconsistency
 and must alter rating criteria             to improve consistency when appropriate
                 
2
 written rating definitions must be clear and detailed enough to allow third             parties to understand  assignment of ratings
 such as internal audit or an             equally independent function and supervisors
" to replicate rating             assignments and evaluate  appropriateness of  grade/pool             assignments"
           
3
 the criteria must also be consistent with  banks internal lending             standards and its policies for handling troubled borrowers and facilities
    36
26 to ensure  banks are consistently taking into account available information
        y must use all relevant and material information in assigning ratings to        borrowers and facilities
 information must be current
 the less information a bank        has
  more conservative must be its assignments of exposures to borrower and        facility grades or pools
 an external rating can be  primary factor determining        an internal rating assignment
 however
  bank must ensure  it considers        or relevant information
      rating criteria
 exposures subject to  supervisory slotting approach    36
27 banks using  supervisory slotting criteria for sl exposures must assign        exposures to ir internal rating grades based on ir own criteria
 systems and        processes
 subject to compliance with  requisite minimum requirements
        banks must n map se internal rating grades into  five supervisory rating        categories
 the slotting criteria tables in  supervisory slotting approach        chapter 
cre33
 provide
 for each sub-class of sl exposures
  general        assessment factors and characteristics exhibited by  exposures  fall under        each of  supervisory categories
 each lending activity has a unique table        describing  assessment factors and characteristics
    36
28 the committee recognises   criteria  banks use to assign exposures to        internal grades will not perfectly align with criteria  define  supervisory        categories
 however
 banks must demonstrate  ir mapping process has        resulted in an alignment of grades which is consistent with  preponderance of         characteristics in  respective supervisory category
 banks should take        special care to ensure  any overrides of ir internal criteria do not render         mapping process ineffective
      rating assignment horizon    36
29 although  time horizon used in pd estimation is one year 
as described in        cre36
64
""
 banks are expected to use a longer time horizon in assigning ratings
          36
30          a borrower rating must represent  banks assessment of  borrowers ability          and willingness to contractually perform despite adverse economic conditions or           occurrence of unexpected events
 for example
 a bank may base rating          assignments on specific
 appropriate stress scenarios
 alternatively
 a bank may          take into account borrower characteristics  are reflective of  borrowers          vulnerability to adverse economic conditions or unexpected events
 without          explicitly specifying a stress scenario
" the range of economic conditions  are          considered when making assessments must be consistent with current conditions          and those  are likely to occur over a business cycle within  respective          industry/geographic region"
    36
31 pd estimates for borrowers  are highly leveraged or for borrowers whose        assets are predominantly traded assets must reflect  performance of         underlying assets based on periods of stressed volatilities
              faq          faq1       how are highly leveraged borrowers to be defined 
eg will non
                    financial entities be included in  definition
?                       the reference to highly leveraged borrowers is intended to capture                     hedge funds or any or equivalently highly leveraged counterparties                      are financial entities
            faq2       how should pds of highly leveraged non-financial counterparties be                     estimated if re are no underlying traded assets or or assets with                     observable prices?                       cre36
31 elaborates on  sentence in cre36
30  states a bank                     may take into account borrower characteristics  are reflective of                      borrowers vulnerability to adverse economic conditions or                     unexpected events
 this means  in  case of highly leveraged                     counterparties where re is likely a significant vulnerability to market                     risk
  bank must assess  potential impact on  counterpartys                     ability to perform  arises from periods of stressed volatilities when                     assigning a rating and corresponding pd to  counterparty under                      irb framework
      36
32 given  difficulties in forecasting future events and  influence y will have        on a particular borrowers financial condition
 a bank must take a conservative        view of projected information
 furrmore
 where limited data are available
 a        bank must adopt a conservative bias to its analysis
          use of models    36
33 the requirements in this section apply to statistical models and or mechanical        methods used to assign borrower or facility ratings or in estimation of pds
 lgds
        or eads
 credit scoring models and or mechanical rating procedures generally        use only a subset of available information
 although mechanical rating        procedures may sometimes avoid some of  idiosyncratic errors made by rating        systems in which human judgement plays a large role
 mechanical use of limited        information also is a source of rating errors
 credit scoring models and or        mechanical procedures are permissible as  primary or partial basis of rating        assignments
 and may play a role in  estimation of loss characteristics
        sufficient human judgement and human oversight is necessary to ensure  all        relevant and material information
 including  which is outside  scope of         model
 is also taken into consideration
 and   model is used        appropriately

 the model must be accurate on             average across  range of borrowers or facilities to which  bank is             exposed and re must be no known material biases
           
2
 the bank must have in place a process for vetting data inputs into a             statistical default or loss prediction model which includes an assessment of              accuracy
 completeness and appropriateness of  data specific to              assignment of an approved rating
           
3
 the bank must demonstrate   data used to build  model are             representative of  population of  banks actual borrowers or facilities

5
 the bank must have procedures for human review of model-based rating             assignments
 such procedures should focus on finding and limiting errors             associated with known model weaknesses and must also include credible             ongoing efforts to improve  models performance

 these guidelines must include        identifying personnel  are responsible for approving se overrides

      data maintenance    36
45 a bank must collect and store data on key borrower and facility characteristics to        provide effective support to its internal credit risk measurement and        management process
 to enable  bank to meet  or requirements in this        document
 and to serve as a basis for supervisory reporting
 these data should be        sufficiently detailed to allow retrospective re-allocation of obligors and facilities        to grades
 for example if increasing sophistication of  internal rating system        suggests  finer segregation of portfolios can be achieved

      stress tests used in assessment of capital adequacy    36
50 an irb bank must have in place sound stress testing processes for use in         assessment of capital adequacy
 stress testing must involve identifying possible        events or future changes in economic conditions  could have unfavourable        effects on a banks credit exposures and assessment of  banks ability to        withstand such changes
 examples of scenarios  could be used are
           
1
 economic or industry downturns
           
2
 market-risk events
 and           
3
 liquidity conditions
          36
51 in addition to  more general tests described above
  bank must perform a        credit risk stress test to assess  effect of certain specific conditions on its irb        regulatory capital requirements
 the test to be employed would be one chosen         by  bank
 subject to supervisory review
 the test to be employed must be         meaningful and reasonably conservative
 individual banks may develop different         approaches to undertaking this stress test requirement
 depending on ir         circumstances
 for this purpose
  objective is not to require banks to consider         worst-case scenarios
 the banks stress test in this context should
 however
         consider at least  effect of mild recession scenarios
 in this case
 one example         might be to use two consecutive quarters of zero growth to assess  effect on          banks pds
 lgds and eads
 taking account  on a conservative basis  of          banks international diversification
    36
52 banks using  double default framework must consider as part of ir stress        testing framework  impact of a deterioration in  credit quality of protection        providers
 in particular  impact of protection providers falling outside         eligibility criteria due to rating changes
 banks should also consider  impact of         default of one but not both of  obligor and protection provider
 and         consequent increase in risk and capital requirements at  time of  default
    36
53 whatever method is used
  bank must include a consideration of  following        sources of information
 first
 a banks own data should allow estimation of         ratings migration of at least some of its exposures
 second
 banks should        consider information about  impact of smaller deterioration in  credit        environment on a banks ratings
 giving some information on  likely effect of        bigger
 stress circumstances
 third
 banks should evaluate evidence of ratings        migration in external ratings
 this would include  bank broadly matching its        buckets to rating categories
    36
54 national supervisors may wish to issue guidance to ir banks on how  tests        to be used for this purpose should be designed
 bearing in mind conditions in        ir jurisdiction
 the results of  stress test may indicate no difference in         capital calculated under  irb rules described in this section of this framework        if  bank already uses such an approach for its internal rating purposes
 where        a bank operates in several markets
 it does not need to test for such conditions in        all of those markets
 but a bank should stress portfolios containing  vast        majority of its total exposures

 so as to ensure                        latter fulfils its tasks
 for this reason
 in some cases
 it is known as a                      supervisory board
 this means   board has no executive                      functions
 in or countries
 by contrast
  board has a broader                      competence in  it lays down  general framework for                       management of  bank
 owing to se differences
  notions of                       board of directors and senior management are used in this paper                      not to identify legal constructs but rar to label two decision-making                      functions within a bank
      36
56 senior management also must have a good understanding of  rating systems        design and operation
 and must approve material differences between        established procedure and actual practice
 management must also ensure
 on an        ongoing basis
   rating system is operating properly

 and corporate        governance functions of banks using  irb approach
 ratings systems and        estimates designed and implemented exclusively for  purpose of qualifying for         irb approach and used only to provide irb inputs are not acceptable
 it is        recognised  banks will not necessarily be using exactly  same estimates for        both irb and all internal purposes
 for example
 pricing models are likely to use        pds and lgds relevant to  life of  asset
 where re are such differences
 a        bank must document m and demonstrate ir reasonableness to         supervisor
    36
62 a bank must have a credible track record in  use of internal ratings        information
 thus
  bank must demonstrate  it has been using a rating        system  was broadly in line with  minimum requirements articulated in this        document for at least  three years prior to qualification
 a bank using         advanced irb approach must demonstrate  it has been estimating and        employing lgds and eads in a manner  is broadly consistent with         minimum requirements for use of own estimates of lgds and eads for at least         three years prior to qualification
 improvements to a banks rating system will        not render a bank non-compliant with  three-year requirement

 and        ead
 generally
 all banks using  irb approaches must estimate a pd for each        internal borrower grade for corporate
 sovereign and bank exposures or for each        pool in  case of retail exposures
      banks are not required to produce ir own estimates of pd for                     certain equity exposures and certain exposures  fall within  sl                     sub-classes
          36
64 pd estimates must be a long-run average of one-year default rates for borrowers        in  grade
 with  exception of retail exposures 
see below
""
 requirements        specific to pd estimation are provided in cre36
78 to cre36

90
 for each of its facilities 
or retail pools
""
 banks on  advanced         approach must also estimate an appropriate long-run default-weighted average         ead for each of its facilities as defined in cre36

 standards for use of such estimates are set out in cre36
124 to         cre36
142
    36
65 internal estimates of pd
 lgd
 and ead must incorporate all relevant
 material        and available data
 information and methods
 a bank may utilise internal data        and data from external sources 
including pooled data
""
 where internal or        external data is used
  bank must demonstrate  its estimates are        representative of long run experience
    36
66 estimates must be grounded in historical experience and empirical evidence
 and        not based purely on subjective or judgmental considerations
 any changes in        lending practice or  process for pursuing recoveries over  observation        period must be taken into account
 a banks estimates must promptly reflect         implications of technical advances and new data and or information
 as it        becomes available
 banks must review ir estimates on a yearly basis or more        frequently
    36
67 the population of exposures represented in  data used for estimation
 and        lending standards in use when  data were generated
 and or relevant        characteristics should be closely matched to or at least comparable with those of         banks exposures and standards
 the bank must also demonstrate         economic or market conditions  underlie  data are relevant to current and        foreseeable conditions
 for estimates of lgd and ead
 banks must take into        account cre36
85 to cre36
97
 the number of exposures in  sample and         data period used for quantification must be sufficient to provide  bank with        confidence in  accuracy and robustness of its estimates
 the estimation        technique must perform well in out-of-sample tests
          36
68 in general
 estimates of pds
 lgds
 and eads are likely to involve unpredictable        errors
 in order to avoid over-optimism
 a bank must add to its estimates a        margin of conservatism  is related to  likely range of errors
 where        methods and data are less satisfactory and  likely range of errors is larger
         margin of conservatism must be larger
 supervisors may allow some flexibility in        application of  required standards for data  are collected prior to  date        of implementation of this framework
 however
 in such cases banks must         demonstrate to ir supervisors  appropriate adjustments have been made         to achieve broad equivalence to  data without such flexibility
 data collected         beyond  date of implementation must conform to  minimum standards         unless orwise stated
      definition of default    36
69 a default is considered to have occurred with regard to a particular obligor when        eir or both of  two following events have taken place
           
1
 the bank considers   obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to              banking group in full
 without recourse by  bank to actions such as             realising security 
if held
""
           
2
 the obligor is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation             to  banking group
 overdrafts will be considered as being past due once              customer has breached an advised limit or been advised of a limit             smaller than current outstandings
      in  case of retail and public sector entity obligations
 for  90 days                     figure
 a supervisor may substitute a figure up to 180 days for different                     products
 as it considers appropriate to local conditions
      36
70 the elements to be taken as indications of unlikeliness to pay include
           
1
 the bank puts  credit obligation on non-accrued status
           
2
 the bank makes a charge-off or account-specific provision resulting from a             significant perceived decline in credit quality subsequent to  bank taking             on  exposure
           
3
 the bank sells  credit obligation at a material credit-related economic loss
                 
4
 the bank consents to a distressed restructuring of  credit obligation             where this is likely to result in a diminished financial obligation caused by                 material forgiveness
 or postponement
 of principal
 interest or 
where              relevant
 fees
           
5
 the bank has filed for  obligors bankruptcy or a similar order in respect             of  obligors credit obligation to  banking group
           
6
 the obligor has sought or has been placed in bankruptcy or similar             protection where this would avoid or delay repayment of  credit             obligation to  banking group
      in some jurisdictions
 specific provisions on equity exposures are set                     aside for price risk and do not signal default
    including
" in  case of equity holdings assessed under a pd/lgd                     approach"
 such distressed restructuring of  equity itself
      36
71 national supervisors will provide appropriate guidance as to how se elements        must be implemented and monitored
    36
72 for retail exposures
  definition of default can be applied at  level of a        particular facility
 rar than at  level of  obligor
 as such
 default by a        borrower on one obligation does not require a bank to treat all or obligations        to  banking group as defaulted
    36
73 a bank must record actual defaults on irb exposure classes using this reference        definition
 a bank must also use  reference definition for its estimation of pds
        and 
where relevant
 lgds and eads
 in arriving at se estimations
 a bank may        use external data available to it  is not itself consistent with  definition
        subject to  requirements set out in cre36
79
 however
 in such cases
 banks        must demonstrate to ir supervisors  appropriate adjustments to  data        have been made to achieve broad equivalence with  reference definition
 this        same condition would apply to any internal data used up to implementation of        this framework
 internal data 
including  pooled by banks
 used in such        estimates beyond  date of implementation of this framework must be        consistent with  reference definition
          36
74 if  bank considers  a previously defaulted exposures status is such  no        trigger of  reference definition any longer applies
  bank must rate                borrower and estimate lgd as y would for a non-defaulted facility
 should          reference definition subsequently be triggered
 a second default would be         deemed to have occurred
      re-ageing    36
75 the bank must have clearly articulated and documented policies in respect of         counting of days past due
 in particular in respect of  re-ageing of  facilities        and  granting of extensions
 deferrals
 renewals and rewrites to existing        accounts
 at a minimum
  re-ageing policy must include
 
a
 approval        authorities and reporting requirements
 
b
 minimum age of a facility before it is        eligible for re-ageing
 
c
 delinquency levels of facilities  are eligible for re
       ageing
 
d
 maximum number of re-ageings per facility
 and 
e
 a reassessment of         borrowers capacity to repay
 these policies must be applied consistently over        time
 and must support  use test 
ie if a bank treats a re-aged exposure in a        similar fashion to or delinquent exposures more than  past-due cut off        point
 this exposure must be recorded as in default for irb purposes
""
      treatment of overdrafts    36
76 authorised overdrafts must be subject to a credit limit set by  bank and        brought to  knowledge of  client
 any break of this limit must be        monitored
 if  account were not brought under  limit after 90 to 180 days        
subject to  applicable past-due trigger
""
 it would be considered as defaulted
        non-authorised overdrafts will be associated with a zero limit for irb purposes
        thus
 days past due commence once any credit is granted to an unauthorised        customer
 if such credit were not repaid within 90 to 180 days
  exposure        would be considered in default
 banks must have in place rigorous internal        policies for assessing  creditworthiness of customers who are offered overdraft        accounts
      definition of loss for all asset classes          36
77 the definition of loss used in estimating lgd is economic loss
 when measuring        economic loss
 all relevant factors should be taken into account
 this must        include material discount effects and material direct and indirect costs associated        with collecting on  exposure
 banks must not simply measure  loss        recorded in accounting records
 although y must be able to compare           accounting and economic losses
 the banks own workout and collection         expertise significantly influences ir recovery rates and must be reflected in         ir lgd estimates
 but adjustments to estimates for such expertise must be         conservative until  bank has sufficient internal empirical evidence of          impact of its expertise
      requirements specific to pd estimation 
 corporate
 sovereign
 and bank exposures    36
78 banks must use information and techniques  take appropriate account of         long-run experience when estimating  average pd for each rating grade
 for        example
 banks may use one or more of  three specific techniques set out        below
 internal default experience
 mapping to external data
 and statistical        default models
    36
79 banks may have a primary technique and use ors as a point of comparison        and potential adjustment
 supervisors will not be satisfied by mechanical        application of a technique without supporting analysis
 banks must recognise         importance of judgmental considerations in combining results of techniques and        in making adjustments for limitations of techniques and information
           
1
 a bank may use data on internal default experience for  estimation of pd
             a bank must demonstrate in its analysis   estimates are reflective of             underwriting standards and of any differences in  rating system              generated  data and  current rating system
 where only limited data             are available
 or where underwriting standards or rating systems have             changed
  bank must add a greater margin of conservatism in its estimate             of pd
 the use of pooled data across institutions may also be recognised
 a             bank must demonstrate   internal rating systems and criteria of or             banks in  pool are comparable with its own
                 
2
 banks may associate or map ir internal grades to  scale used by an             external credit assessment institution or similar institution and n attribute              default rate observed for  external institutions grades to  banks             grades
 mappings must be based on a comparison of internal rating criteria             to  criteria used by  external institution and on a comparison of              internal and external ratings of any common borrowers
 biases or             inconsistencies in  mapping approach or underlying data must be             avoided
 the external institutions criteria underlying  data used for             quantification must be oriented to  risk of  borrower and not reflect             transaction characteristics
 the banks analysis must include a comparison of              default definitions used
 subject to  requirements in cre36
69 to             cre36

81 given  bank-specific basis of assigning exposures to pools
 banks must regard        internal data as  primary source of information for estimating loss        characteristics
 banks are permitted to use external data or statistical models for        quantification provided a strong link can be demonstrated between 
a
  banks        process of assigning exposures to a pool and  process used by  external        data source
 and

82 one method for deriving long-run average estimates of pd and default-weighted        average loss rates given default 
as defined in cre36
85
 for retail would be        based on an estimate of  expected long-run loss rate
 a bank may 
i
 use an        appropriate pd estimate to infer  long-run default-weighted average loss rate        given default
 or 
ii
 use a long-run default-weighted average loss rate given        default to infer  appropriate pd
 in eir case
 it is important to recognise                 lgd used for  irb capital calculation cannot be less than  long-run         default-weighted average loss rate given default and must be consistent with          concepts defined in cre36

 a bank need not give equal        importance to historic data if it can convince its supervisor  more recent data        are a better predictor of loss rates
    36
84 the committee recognises  seasoning can be quite material for some long
       term retail exposures characterised by seasoning effects  peak several years        after origination
 banks should anticipate  implications of rapid exposure        growth and take steps to ensure  ir estimation techniques are accurate
        and  ir current capital level and earnings and funding prospects are        adequate to cover ir future capital needs
 in order to avoid gyrations in ir        required capital positions arising from short-term pd horizons
 banks are also        encouraged to adjust pd estimates upward for anticipated seasoning effects
        provided such adjustments are applied in a consistent fashion over time
 within        some jurisdictions
 such adjustments might be made mandatory
 subject to        supervisory discretion
      requirements specific to own-lgd estimates
 standards for all asset classes          36
85 a bank must estimate an lgd for each facility  aims to reflect economic        downturn conditions where necessary to capture  relevant risks
 this lgd        cannot be less than  long-run default-weighted average loss rate given default        calculated based on  average economic loss of all observed defaults within         data source for  type of facility
 in addition
 a bank must take into account         potential for  lgd of  facility to be higher than  default-weighted        average during a period when credit losses are substantially higher than average
        for certain types of exposures
 loss severities may not exhibit such cyclical        variability and lgd estimates may not differ materially 
or possibly at all
 from         long-run default-weighted average
 however
 for or exposures
 this cyclical        variability in loss severities may be important and banks will need to incorporate        it into ir lgd estimates
 for this purpose
 banks may use averages of loss        severities observed during periods of high credit losses
 forecasts based on        appropriately conservative assumptions
 or or similar methods
" appropriate        estimates of lgd during periods of high credit losses might be formed using        eir internal and/or external data"
 supervisors will continue to monitor and        encourage  development of appropriate approaches to this issue
    36
86 in its analysis
  bank must consider  extent of any dependence between         risk of  borrower and  of  collateral or collateral provider
 cases where        re is a significant degree of dependence must be addressed in a conservative        manner
 any currency mismatch between  underlying obligation and         collateral must also be considered and treated conservatively in  banks        assessment of lgd
    36
87 lgd estimates must be grounded in historical recovery rates and
 when        applicable
 must not solely be based on  collaterals estimated market value
        this requirement recognises  potential inability of banks to gain both control        of ir collateral and liquidate it expeditiously
 to  extent
  lgd estimates        take into account  existence of collateral
 banks must establish internal        requirements for collateral management
 operational procedures
 legal certainty        and risk management process  are generally consistent with those required        for  standardised approach
          36
88 recognising  principle  realised losses can at times systematically exceed        expected levels
  lgd assigned to a defaulted asset should reflect         possibility   bank would have to recognise additional
 unexpected losses        during  recovery period
 for each defaulted asset
  bank must also        construct its best estimate of  expected loss on  asset based on current        economic circumstances and facility status
 the amount
 if any
 by which  lgd        on a defaulted asset exceeds  banks best estimate of expected loss on         asset represents  capital requirement for  asset

  bank should have an        effective internal process for assessing compliance with all critical policies and        procedures
 including
           
1
" regular internal and/or external audits of all critical phases of  banks             receivables purchase programme           "
2
 verification of  separation of duties                
a
" between  assessment of  seller/servicer and  assessment of                   obligor"
 and                
b
" between  assessment of  seller/servicer and  field audit of                   seller/servicer"
    36
117 a banks effective internal process for assessing compliance with all critical        policies and procedures should also include evaluations of back office operations
        with particular focus on qualifications
 experience
 staffing levels
 and supporting        systems
      section 8
 validation of internal estimates  36
118 banks must have a robust system in place to validate  accuracy and        consistency of rating systems
 processes
 and  estimation of all relevant risk        components
 a bank must demonstrate to its supervisor   internal        validation process enables it to assess  performance of internal rating and risk        estimation systems consistently and meaningfully
          36
119 banks must regularly compare realised default rates with estimated pds for each        grade and be able to demonstrate   realised default rates are within         expected range for  grade
 banks using  advanced irb approach must        complete such analysis for ir estimates of lgds and eads
 such comparisons        must make use of historical data  are over as long a period as possible
 the         methods and data used in such comparisons by  bank must be clearly         documented by  bank
 this analysis and documentation must be updated at         least annually
    36
120 banks must also use or quantitative validation tools and comparisons with        relevant external data sources
 the analysis must be based on data  are        appropriate to  portfolio
 are updated regularly
 and cover a relevant        observation period
 banks internal assessments of  performance of ir own        rating systems must be based on long data histories
 covering a range of        economic conditions
 and ideally one or more complete business cycles
     36
121 banks must demonstrate  quantitative testing methods and or validation        methods do not vary systematically with  economic cycle
 changes in methods        and data 
both data sources and periods covered
 must be clearly and thoroughly        documented
    36
122 banks must have well-articulated internal standards for situations where        deviations in realised pds
 lgds and eads from expectations become significant        enough to call  validity of  estimates into question
 these standards must        take account of business cycles and similar systematic variability in default        experiences
 where realised values continue to be higher than expected values
        banks must revise estimates upward to reflect ir default and loss experience
    36
123 where banks rely on supervisory
 rar than internal
 estimates of risk        parameters
 y are encouraged to compare realised lgds and eads to those        set by  supervisors
 the information on realised lgds and eads should form        part of  banks assessment of economic capital
      section 9
 supervisory lgd and ead estimates  36
124 banks under  foundation irb approach
 which do not meet  requirements        for own-estimates of lgd and ead
 above
 must meet  minimum        requirements described in  standardised approach to receive recognition for        eligible financial collateral 
as set out in  credit risk mitigation chapter of         standardised approach 
cre22
""
 they must meet  following additional        minimum requirements in order to receive recognition for additional collateral        types
          definition of eligibility of commercial real estate and residential real estate as  collateral    36
125 eligible commercial and residential real estate collateral for corporate
 sovereign        and bank exposures are defined as
           
1
 collateral where  risk of  borrower is not materially dependent upon              performance of  underlying property or project
 but rar on              underlying capacity of  borrower to repay  debt from or sources
 as             such
 repayment of  facility is not materially dependent on any cash flow             generated by  underlying commercial or residential real estate serving as             collateral
 and           
2
 additionally
  value of  collateral pledged must not be materially             dependent on  performance of  borrower
 this requirement is not             intended to preclude situations where purely macro-economic factors affect             both  value of  collateral and  performance of  borrower
       the committee recognises  in some countries where multifamily                     housing makes up an important part of  housing market and where                     public policy is supportive of  sector
 including specially established                     public sector companies as major providers
  risk characteristics of                     lending secured by mortgage on such residential real estate can be                     similar to those of traditional corporate exposures
 the national                     supervisor may under such circumstances recognise mortgage on                     multifamily residential real estate as eligible collateral for corporate                     exposures
      36
126 in light of  generic description above and  definition of corporate        exposures
 income producing real estate  falls under  sl asset class is        specifically excluded from recognition as collateral for corporate exposures
           as noted in  footnote to cre32
7
 in exceptional circumstances for                      well-developed and long-established markets
" mortgages on office and                      /or multi-purpose commercial premises and/or multi-tenanted                      commercial premises may have  potential to receive recognition as                      collateral in  corporate portfolio"

25 for a discussion of  eligibility criteria  would apply
        operational requirements for eligible commercial or residential real estate    36
127 subject to meeting  definition above
 commercial and residential real estate        will be eligible for recognition as collateral for corporate claims only if all of         following operational requirements are met
           
1
 legal enforceability
 any claim on a collateral taken must be legally             enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions
 and any claim on collateral must be             properly filed on a timely basis
 collateral interests must reflect a perfected             lien 
ie all legal requirements for establishing  claim have been fulfilled
""
             furrmore
  collateral agreement and  legal process underpinning it             must be such  y provide for  bank to realise  value of              collateral within a reasonable timeframe
           
2
 objective market value of collateral
  collateral must be valued at or less             than  current fair value under which  property could be sold under             private contract between a willing seller and an arms-length buyer on              date of valuation
           
3
 frequent revaluation
  bank is expected to monitor  value of              collateral on a frequent basis and at a minimum once every year
 more             frequent monitoring is suggested where  market is subject to significant             changes in conditions
 statistical methods of evaluation 
eg reference to             house price indices
 sampling
 may be used to update estimates or to             identify collateral  may have declined in value and  may need re
            appraisal
 a qualified professional must evaluate  property when             information indicates   value of  collateral may have declined             materially relative to general market prices or when a credit event
 such as             default
 occurs
                  
4
 junior liens
 in some member countries
 eligible collateral will be restricted to            situations where  lender has a first charge over  property
 junior liens            may be taken into account where re is no doubt   claim for            collateral is legally enforceable and constitutes an efficient credit risk            mitigant
 when recognised
 junior liens are to be treated using  c
"/c"
""
               threshold
 which is used for senior liens
 in such cases
  c
 and c
""
 are             calculated by taking into account  sum of  junior lien and all more             senior liens
      in some of se jurisdictions
 first liens are subject to  prior right of                    preferential creditors
 such as outstanding tax claims and employees                    wages
      36
128 additional collateral management requirements are as follows
          
1
 the types of commercial and residential real estate collateral accepted by             bank and lending policies 
advance rates
 when this type of collateral is            taken must be clearly documented
          
2
 the bank must take steps to ensure   property taken as collateral is            adequately insured against damage or deterioration
          
3
 the bank must monitor on an ongoing basis  extent of any permissible            prior claims 
eg tax
 on  property
          
4
 the bank must appropriately monitor  risk of environmental liability            arising in respect of  collateral
 such as  presence of toxic material on a            property
      requirements for recognition of financial receivables 
 definition of eligible  receivables        36
129 eligible financial receivables are claims with an original maturity of less than or        equal to one year where repayment will occur through  commercial or        financial flows related to  underlying assets of  borrower
 this includes        both self-liquidating debt arising from  sale of goods or services linked to a        commercial transaction and general amounts owed by buyers
 suppliers
 renters
        national and local governmental authorities
 or or non-affiliated parties not        related to  sale of goods or services linked to a commercial transaction
        eligible receivables do not include those associated with securitisations
 sub
       participations or credit derivatives
      requirements for recognition of financial receivables
 legal certainty    36
130 the legal mechanism by which collateral is given must be robust and ensure          lender has clear rights over  proceeds from  collateral
    36
131 banks must take all steps necessary to fulfil local requirements in respect of         enforceability of security interest
 eg by registering a security interest with a        registrar
 there should be a framework  allows  potential lender to have a        perfected first priority claim over  collateral
    36
132 all documentation used in collateralised transactions must be binding on all        parties and legally enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions
 banks must have        conducted sufficient legal review to verify this and have a well-founded legal        basis to reach this conclusion
 and undertake such furr review as necessary to        ensure continuing enforceability
    36
133 the collateral arrangements must be properly documented
 with a clear and        robust procedure for  timely collection of collateral proceeds
 banks        procedures should ensure  any legal conditions required for declaring         default of  customer and timely collection of collateral are observed
 in         event of  obligors financial distress or default
  bank should have legal        authority to sell or assign  receivables to or parties without consent of         receivables obligors
      requirements for recognition of financial receivables
 risk management    36
134 the bank must have a sound process for determining  credit risk in         receivables
 such a process should include
 among or things
 analyses of         borrowers business and industry 
""
 effects of  business cycle
 and  types        of customers with whom  borrower does business
 where  bank relies on         borrower to ascertain  credit risk of  customers
  bank must review         borrowers credit policy to ascertain its soundness and credibility
          36
135           the margin between  amount of  exposure and  value of  receivables         must reflect all appropriate factors
 including  cost of collection
 concentration         within  receivables pool pledged by an individual borrower
 and potential         concentration risk within  banks total exposures
    36
136 the bank must maintain a continuous monitoring process  is appropriate for         specific exposures 
eir immediate or contingent
 attributable to         collateral to be utilised as a risk mitigant
 this process may include
 as        appropriate and relevant
 ageing reports
 control of trade documents
 borrowing        base certificates
 frequent audits of collateral
 confirmation of accounts
 control of         proceeds of accounts paid
 analyses of dilution 
credits given by  borrower        to  issuers
 and regular financial analysis of both  borrower and  issuers        of  receivables
 especially in  case when a small number of large-sized        receivables are taken as collateral
 observance of  banks overall concentration        limits should be monitored
 additionally
 compliance with loan covenants
        environmental restrictions
 and or legal requirements should be reviewed on a        regular basis
    36
137 the receivables pledged by a borrower should be diversified and not be unduly        correlated with  borrower
 where  correlation is high
 
 where some        issuers of  receivables are reliant on  borrower for ir viability or         borrower and  issuers belong to a common industry
  attendant risks        should be taken into account in  setting of margins for  collateral pool as a        whole
 receivables from affiliates of  borrower 
including subsidiaries and        employees
 will not be recognised as risk mitigants
    36
138 the bank should have a documented process for collecting receivable payments        in distressed situations
 the requisite facilities for collection should be in place
        even when  bank normally looks to  borrower for collections
      requirements for recognition of or physical collateral    36
139 supervisors may allow for recognition of  credit risk mitigating effect of certain        or physical collateral
 each supervisor will determine which
 if any
 collateral        types in its jurisdiction meet  following two standards
           
1
 existence of liquid markets for disposal of collateral in an expeditious and             economically efficient manner
                 
2
 existence of well established
 publicly available market prices for              collateral
 supervisors will seek to ensure   amount a bank receives             when collateral is realised does not deviate significantly from se market             prices
    36
140 in order for a given bank to receive recognition for additional physical collateral
        it must meet all  standards in cre36
127 and cre36
128
 subject to         following modifications
           
1
 with  sole exception of permissible prior claims specified in  footnote             to cre36
127
 only first liens on
 or charges over
 collateral are permissible
             as such
  bank must have priority over all or lenders to  realised             proceeds of  collateral
           
2
 the loan agreement must include detailed descriptions of  collateral plus             detailed specifications of  manner and frequency of revaluation
           
3
" the types of physical collateral accepted by  bank and policies and             practices in respect of  appropriate amount of each type of collateral             relative to  exposure amount must be clearly documented in internal             credit policies and procedures and available for examination and/or audit             review"
           
4
 bank credit policies with regard to  transaction structure must address             appropriate collateral requirements relative to  exposure amount
              ability to liquidate  collateral readily
  ability to establish objectively a             price or market value
  frequency with which  value can readily be             obtained 
including a professional appraisal or valuation
""
 and  volatility             of  value of  collateral
 the periodic revaluation process must pay             particular attention to fashion-sensitive collateral to ensure  valuations             are appropriately adjusted downward of fashion
 or model-year
             obsolescence as well as physical obsolescence or deterioration
           
5
 in cases of inventories 
eg raw materials
 work-in-process
 finished goods
             dealers inventories of autos
 and equipment
  periodic revaluation             process must include physical inspection of  collateral
      section 10
 requirements for recognition of leasing  36
141 leases or than those  expose  bank to residual value risk 
see cre36
142        below
 will be accorded  same treatment as exposures collateralised by         same type of collateral
 the minimum requirements for  collateral type must        be met 
commercial or residential real estate or or collateral
""
 in addition
         bank must also meet  following standards
           
1
 robust risk management on  part of  lessor with respect to              location of  asset
  use to which it is put
 its age
 and planned             obsolescence
           
2
 a robust legal framework establishing  lessors legal ownership of              asset and its ability to exercise its rights as owner in a timely fashion
 and           
3
 the difference between  rate of depreciation of  physical asset and              rate of amortisation of  lease payments must not be so large as to             overstate  credit risk mitigation attributed to  leased assets
    36
142 leases  expose  bank to residual value risk will be treated in  following        manner
 residual value risk is  banks exposure to potential loss due to  fair        value of  equipment declining below its residual estimate at lease inception
           
1
 the discounted lease payment stream will receive a risk weight appropriate             for  lessees financial strength 
pd
 and supervisory or own-estimate of             lgd
 whichever is appropriate
           
2
 the residual value will be risk-weighted at 100%
      section 11
 calculation of capital charges for equity exposures    the internal models market-based approach    36
143 to be eligible for  internal models market-based approach a bank must        demonstrate to its supervisor  it meets certain quantitative and qualitative        minimum requirements at  outset and on an ongoing basis
 a bank  fails        to demonstrate continued compliance with  minimum requirements must        develop a plan for rapid return to compliance
 obtain its supervisors approval of         plan
 and implement  plan in a timely fashion
 in  interim
 banks would        be expected to compute capital charges using a simple risk weight approach
    36
144 the committee recognises  differences in markets
 measurement        methodologies
 equity investments and management practices require banks and        supervisors to customise ir operational procedures
 it is not  committees        intention to dictate  form or operational detail of banks risk management        policies and measurement practices for ir banking book equity holdings
        however
 some of  minimum requirements are specific
 each supervisor will        develop detailed examination procedures to ensure  banks risk measurement        systems and management controls are adequate to serve as  basis for         internal models approach
        capital charge and risk quantification    36
145 the following minimum quantitative standards apply for  purpose of        calculating minimum capital charges under  internal models approach
          
1
 the capital charge is equivalent to  potential loss on  institutions            equity portfolio arising from an assumed instantaneous shock equivalent to             99th percentile
 one-tailed confidence interval of  difference between            quarterly returns and an appropriate risk-free rate computed over a long
           term sample period
          
2
 the estimated losses should be robust to adverse market movements            relevant to  long-term risk profile of  institutions specific holdings
            the data used to represent return distributions should reflect  longest            sample period for which data are available and meaningful in representing             risk profile of  banks specific equity holdings
 the data used should            be sufficient to provide conservative
 statistically reliable and robust loss            estimates  are not based purely on subjective or judgmental            considerations
 institutions must demonstrate to supervisors   shock            employed provides a conservative estimate of potential losses over a            relevant long-term market or business cycle
 models estimated using data            not reflecting realistic ranges of long-run experience
 including a period of            reasonably severe declines in equity market values relevant to a banks            holdings
 are presumed to produce optimistic results unless re is credible            evidence of appropriate adjustments built into  model
 in  absence of            built-in adjustments
  bank must combine empirical analysis of available            data with adjustments based on a variety of factors in order to attain model            outputs  achieve appropriate realism and conservatism
 in constructing            value-at-risk 
var
 models estimating potential quarterly losses
 institutions            may use quarterly data or convert shorter horizon period data to a quarterly            equivalent using an analytically appropriate method supported by empirical            evidence
 such adjustments must be applied through a well-developed and            well-documented thought process and analysis
 in general
 adjustments            must be applied conservatively and consistently over time
 furrmore
            where only limited data are available
 or where technical limitations are such             estimates from any single method will be of uncertain quality
 banks            must add appropriate margins of conservatism in order to avoid over
           optimism
         
3
 no particular type of var model 
eg variance-covariance
 historical           simulation
 or monte carlo
 is prescribed
 however
  model used must be           able to capture adequately all of  material risks embodied in equity           returns including both  general market risk and specific risk exposure of            institutions equity portfolio
 internal models must adequately explain           historical price variation
 capture both  magnitude and changes in            composition of potential concentrations
 and be robust to adverse market           environments
 the population of risk exposures represented in  data used           for estimation must be closely matched to or at least comparable with those           of  banks equity exposures
         
4
 banks may also use modelling techniques such as historical scenario analysis           to determine minimum capital requirements for banking book equity           holdings
 the use of such models is conditioned upon  institution           demonstrating to its supervisor   methodology and its output can be           quantified in  form of  loss percentile specified under 
1
""
         
5
 institutions must use an internal model  is appropriate for  risk profile           and complexity of ir equity portfolio
 institutions with material holdings           with values  are highly non-linear in nature 
eg equity derivatives
           convertibles
 must employ an internal model designed to capture           appropriately  risks associated with such instruments
         
6
 subject to supervisory review
 equity portfolio correlations can be integrated           into a banks internal risk measures
 the use of explicit correlations 
"eg           utilisation of a variance/covariance var model"
 must be fully documented           and supported using empirical analysis
 the appropriateness of implicit           correlation assumptions will be evaluated by supervisors in ir review of           model documentation and estimation techniques
         
7
 mapping of individual positions to proxies
 market indices
 and risk factors           should be plausible
 intuitive
 and conceptually sound
 mapping techniques           and processes should be fully documented
 and demonstrated with both           oretical and empirical evidence to be appropriate for  specific           holdings
 where professional judgement is combined with quantitative           techniques in estimating a holdings return volatility
  judgement must           take into account  relevant and material information not considered by            or techniques utilised
           
8
 where factor models are used
 eir single or multi-factor models are             acceptable depending upon  nature of an institutions holdings
 banks are             expected to ensure   factors are sufficient to capture  risks             inherent in  equity portfolio
 risk factors should correspond to              appropriate equity market characteristics 
for example
 public
 private

 the number of risk exposures in  sample
 and              data period used for quantification must be sufficient to provide  bank             with confidence in  accuracy and robustness of its estimates
 institutions             should take appropriate measures to limit  potential of both sampling             bias and survivorship bias in estimating return volatilities
           
10
 a rigorous and comprehensive stress-testing programme must be in place
              banks are expected to subject ir internal model and estimation              procedures

146 banks overall risk management practices used to manage ir banking book        equity investments are expected to be consistent with  evolving sound        practice guidelines issued by  committee and national supervisors
 with        regard to  development and use of internal models for capital purposes
        institutions must have established policies
 procedures
 and controls to ensure         integrity of  model and modelling process used to derive regulatory        capital standards
 these policies

 and controls should include         following
             
1
 full integration of  internal model into  overall management             information systems of  institution and in  management of              banking book equity portfolio

 and review of model results
 such as direct verification of risk             computations
 proxy and mapping techniques and or critical model             components should receive special attention

3
 adequate systems and procedures for monitoring investment limits and              risk exposures of equity investments

 the units responsible for  design and application of  model must be             functionally independent from  units responsible for managing individual             investments
           
5
 parties responsible for any aspect of  modelling process must be             adequately qualified
 management must allocate sufficient skilled and             competent resources to  modelling function
      validation and documentation    36
147 institutions employing internal models for regulatory capital purposes are        expected to have in place a robust system to validate  accuracy and        consistency of  model and its inputs
 they must also fully document all        material elements of ir internal models and modelling process
 the modelling        process itself as well as  systems used to validate internal models including all        supporting documentation
 validation results
 and  findings of internal and        external reviews are subject to oversight and review by  banks supervisor
      validation    36
148 banks must have a robust system in place to validate  accuracy and        consistency of ir internal models and modelling processes
 a bank must        demonstrate to its supervisor   internal validation process enables it to        assess  performance of its internal model and processes consistently and        meaningfully
    36
149 banks must regularly compare actual return performance 
computed using        realised and unrealised gains and losses
 with modelled estimates and be able to        demonstrate  such returns are within  expected range for  portfolio and        individual holdings
 such comparisons must make use of historical data  are        over as long a period as possible
 the methods and data used in such        comparisons must be clearly documented by  bank
 this analysis and        documentation should be updated at least annually
    36
150 banks should make use of or quantitative validation tools and comparisons        with external data sources
 the analysis must be based on data  are        appropriate to  portfolio
 are updated regularly
 and cover a relevant        observation period
 banks internal assessments of  performance of ir own        model must be based on long data histories
 covering a range of economic        conditions
 and ideally one or more complete business cycles
    36
151 banks must demonstrate  quantitative validation methods and data are        consistent through time
 changes in estimation methods and data 
both data        sources and periods covered
 must be clearly and thoroughly documented
    36
152 since  evaluation of actual performance to expected performance over time        provides a basis for banks to refine and adjust internal models on an ongoing        basis
 it is expected  banks using internal models will have established well
       articulated model review standards
 these standards are especially important for        situations where actual results significantly deviate from expectations and where         validity of  internal model is called into question
 these standards must        take account of business cycles and similar systematic variability in equity returns
        all adjustments made to internal models in response to model reviews must be        well documented and consistent with  banks model review standards
      36
153 to facilitate model validation through backtesting on an ongoing basis
        institutions using  internal model approach must construct and maintain        appropriate databases on  actual quarterly performance of ir equity        investments as well on  estimates derived using ir internal models
        institutions should also backtest  volatility estimates used within ir internal        models and  appropriateness of  proxies used in  model
 supervisors         may ask banks to scale ir quarterly forecasts to a different
 in particular         shorter
 time horizon
 store performance data for this time horizon and perform         backtests on this basis

154 the burden is on  bank to satisfy its supervisor  a model has good        predictive power and  regulatory capital requirements will not be distorted as        a result of its use
 accordingly
 all critical elements of an internal model and         modelling process should be fully and adequately documented
 banks must        document in writing ir internal models design and operational details
 the        documentation should demonstrate banks compliance with  minimum        quantitative and qualitative standards
 and should address topics such as         application of  model to different segments of  portfolio
 estimation        methodologies
 responsibilities of parties involved in  modelling
 and         model approval and model review processes
 in particular
  documentation        should address  following points
           
1
 a bank must document  rationale for its choice of internal modelling             methodology and must be able to provide analyses demonstrating               model and modelling procedures are likely to result in estimates              meaningfully identify  risk of  banks equity holdings
 internal models             and procedures must be periodically reviewed to determine wher y             remain fully applicable to  current portfolio and to external conditions
 in             addition
 a bank must document a history of major changes in  model             over time and changes made to  modelling process subsequent to              last supervisory review
 if changes have been made in response to  banks             internal review standards
  bank must document  se changes are             consistent with its internal model review standards

 where proxies and mapping are employed
 institutions must have performed             and documented rigorous analysis demonstrating  all chosen proxies             and mappings are sufficiently representative of  risk of  equity             holdings to which y correspond

1   banks must apply  securitisation framework for determining regulatory capital         requirements on exposures arising from traditional and syntic securitisations         or similar structures  contain features common to both
 since securitisations         may be structured in many different ways
  capital treatment of a securitisation         exposure must be determined on  basis of its economic substance rar than         its legal form
 similarly
 supervisors will look to  economic substance of a         transaction to determine wher it should be subject to  securitisation         framework for purposes of determining regulatory capital
 banks are encouraged         to consult with ir national supervisors when re is uncertainty about wher         a given transaction should be considered a securitisation
 for example
         transactions involving cash flows from real estate 
eg rents
 may be considered         specialised lending exposures
 if warranted
    40
2   a traditional securitisation is a structure where  cash flow from an underlying         pool of exposures is used to service at least two different stratified risk positions         or tranches reflecting different degrees of credit risk
 payments to  investors         depend upon  performance of  specified underlying exposures
 as opposed         to being derived from an obligation of  entity originating those exposures
"         the stratified/tranched structures  characterise securitisations differ from         ordinary senior/subordinated debt instruments in  junior securitisation         tranches can absorb losses without interrupting contractual payments to more         senior tranches"
" whereas subordination in a senior/subordinated debt structure is         a matter of priority of rights to  proceeds of liquidation"
    40
3   a syntic securitisation is a structure with at least two different stratified risk         positions or tranches  reflect different degrees of credit risk where credit risk         of an underlying pool of exposures is transferred
 in whole or in part
 through          use of funded 
eg credit-linked notes
 or unfunded 
eg credit default swaps
         credit derivatives or guarantees  serve to hedge  credit risk of          portfolio
 accordingly
  investors potential risk is dependent upon          performance of  underlying pool
    40
4   banks exposures to a securitisation are hereafter referred to as securitisation         exposures
 securitisation exposures can include but are not restricted to          following
 asset-backed securities
 mortgage-backed securities
 credit         enhancements
 liquidity facilities
 interest rate or currency swaps
 credit         derivatives and tranched cover as described in cre22
93
 reserve accounts
 such         as cash collateral accounts
 recorded as an asset by  originating bank must         also be treated as securitisation exposures
        40
5         a resecuritisation exposure is a securitisation exposure in which  risk         associated with an underlying pool of exposures is tranched and at least one of          underlying exposures is a securitisation exposure
 in addition
 an exposure to         one or more resecuritisation exposures is a resecuritisation exposure
 an         exposure resulting from retranching of a securitisation exposure is not a         resecuritisation exposure if  bank is able to demonstrate   cash flows to         and from  bank could be replicated in all circumstances and conditions by an         exposure to  securitisation of a pool of assets  contains no securitisation         exposures

 and private equity         investments
 the underlying pool may include one or more exposures
      definitions and general terminology  40
7   for risk-based capital purposes
 a bank is considered to be an originator with         regard to a certain securitisation if it meets eir of  following conditions
           
1
  bank originates directly or indirectly underlying exposures included in              securitisation
 or           
2
  bank serves as a sponsor of an asset-backed commercial paper 
abcp
             conduit or similar programme  acquires exposures from third-party             entities
 in  context of such programmes
 a bank would generally be             considered a sponsor and
 in turn
 an originator if it
 in fact or in substance
             manages or advises  programme
 places securities into  market
" or             provides liquidity and/or credit enhancements"
    40
8   an abcp programme predominantly issues commercial paper to third-party         investors with an original maturity of one year or less and is backed by assets or         or exposures held in a bankruptcy-remote
 special purpose entity
    40
9   a clean-up call is an option  permits  securitisation exposures 
eg asset
        backed securities
 to be called before all of  underlying exposures or         securitisation exposures have been repaid
 in  case of traditional         securitisations
 this is generally accomplished by repurchasing  remaining         securitisation exposures once  pool balance or outstanding securities have         fallen below some specified level
 in  case of a syntic transaction
  clean
        up call may take  form of a clause  extinguishes  credit protection
      40
10            a credit enhancement is a contractual arrangement in which  bank or or          entity retains or assumes a securitisation exposure and
 in substance
 provides          some degree of added protection to or parties to  transaction
    40
11 a credit-enhancing interest-only strip 
"i/o"
 is an on-balance sheet asset             
1
 represents a valuation of cash flows related to future margin income
 and            
2
 is subordinated
    40
12 an early amortisation provision is a mechanism 
 once triggered
 accelerates         reduction of  investors interest in underlying exposures of a securitisation        of revolving credit facilities and allows investors to be paid out prior to         originally stated maturity of  securities issued
 a securitisation of revolving        credit facilities is a securitisation in which one or more underlying exposures        represent
 directly or indirectly
 current or future draws on a revolving credit        facility
 examples of revolving credit facilities include but are not limited to credit        card exposures
 home equity lines of credit
 commercial lines of credit
 and or        lines of credit
    40
13 excess spread 
or future margin income
 is defined as gross finance charge        collections and or income received by  trust or special purpose entity 
spe
        as defined below
 minus certificate interest
 servicing fees
 charge-offs
 and or        senior trust or spe expenses
    40
14 implicit support arises when a bank provides support to a securitisation in excess        of its predetermined contractual obligation
        40
15 for risk-based capital purposes
 an internal ratings-based 
irb
 pool means a        securitisation pool for which a bank is able to use an irb approach to calculate        capital requirements for all underlying exposures given  it has approval to        apply irb for  type of underlying exposures and it has sufficient information to        calculate irb capital requirements for se exposures
 supervisors should expect         a bank with supervisory approval to calculate capital requirements for         type of underlying exposures be able to obtain sufficient information to estimate        capital requirements for  underlying pool of exposures using an irb approach
        a bank which has a supervisory-approved irb approach for  entire pool of        exposures underlying a given securitisation exposure  cannot estimate capital        requirements for all underlying exposures using an irb approach would be        expected to demonstrate to its supervisor why it is unable to do so
 however
 a        supervisor may prohibit a bank from treating an irb pool as such in  case of        particular structures or transactions
 including transactions with highly complex        loss allocations
 tranches whose credit enhancement could be eroded for reasons        or than portfolio losses
 and tranches of portfolios with high internal        correlations 
such as portfolios with high exposure to single sectors or with high        geographical concentration
""
    40
16 for risk-based capital purposes
 a mixed pool means a securitisation pool for        which a bank is able to calculate irb parameters for some
 but not all
 underlying        exposures in a securitisation
    40
17 for risk-based capital purposes
 a standardised approach 
sa
 pool means a        securitisation pool for which a bank does not have approval to calculate irb        parameters for any underlying exposures
 or for which
 while  bank has        approval to calculate irb parameters for some or all of  types of underlying        exposures
 it is unable to calculate irb parameters for any underlying exposures        because of lack of relevant data
 or is prohibited by its supervisor from treating         pool as an irb pool pursuant to cre40
15
    40
18 a securitisation exposure 
tranche
 is considered to be a senior exposure        
tranche
 if it is effectively backed or secured by a first claim on  entire amount        of  assets in  underlying securitised pool
 while this generally includes        only  most senior position within a securitisation transaction
 in some        instances re may be or claims 
 in a technical sense
 may be more        senior in  waterfall 
eg a swap claim
 but may be disregarded for  purpose        of determining which positions are treated as senior
 different maturities of        several senior tranches  share pro rata loss allocation shall have no effect on         seniority of se tranches
 since y benefit from  same level of credit        enhancement
 the material effects of differing tranche maturities are captured by        maturity adjustments on  risk weights to be assigned to  securitisation        exposures
 for example
          
1
 in a typical syntic securitisation
 an unrated tranche would be treated as a            senior tranche
 provided  all of  conditions for inferring a rating from            a lower tranche  meets  definition of a senior tranche are fulfilled
          
2
 in a traditional securitisation where all tranches above  first-loss piece are            rated
  most highly rated position would be treated as a senior tranche
            when re are several tranches  share  same rating
 only  most            senior tranche in  cash flow waterfall would be treated as senior 
unless             only difference among m is  effective maturity
""
 also
 when             different ratings of several senior tranches only result from a difference in            maturity
 all of se tranches should be treated as a senior tranche
          
3
 usually
 a liquidity facility supporting an abcp programme would not be             most senior position within  programme
  commercial paper
 which            benefits from  liquidity support
 typically would be  most senior            position
 however
" a liquidity facility may be viewed as covering all losses on             underlying receivables pool  exceed  amount of            overcollateralisation/reserves provided by  seller and as being most            senior if it is sized to cover all of  outstanding commercial paper and            or senior debt supported by  pool"
 so  no cash flows from             underlying pool could be transferred to  or creditors until any liquidity            draws were repaid in full
 in such a case
  liquidity facility can be treated            as a senior exposure
 orwise
 if se conditions are not satisfied
 or if for            or reasons  liquidity facility constitutes a mezzanine position in            economic substance rar than a senior position in  underlying pool
             liquidity facility should be treated as a non-senior exposure
      if a senior tranche is retranched or partially hedged 
ie not on a pro                    rata basis
""
 only  new senior part would be treated as senior for                    capital purposes
      40
19 for risk-based capital purposes
  exposure amount of a securitisation exposure        is  sum of  on-balance sheet amount of  exposure
" or carrying value         which takes into account purchase discounts and writedowns/specific provisions         bank took on this securitisation exposure  and  off-balance sheet        exposure amount"
 where applicable
    40
20 a bank must measure  exposure amount of its off-balance sheet securitisation        exposures as follows
                 
1
 for credit risk mitigants sold or purchased by  bank
 use  treatment set             out in cre40
56 to cre40
62
           
2
 for facilities  are not credit risk mitigants
 use a credit conversion factor

  undrawn portion of servicer cash advances or facilities  are             unconditionally cancellable without prior notice may receive  ccf for             unconditionally cancellable commitments under cre20
 for this purpose
 a             national supervisor  uses this discretion must develop an appropriately             conservative method for measuring  amount of  undrawn portion
 and

 for derivatives contracts or than credit risk derivatives contracts
 such as             interest rate or currency swaps sold or purchased by  bank
 use              measurement approach set out in cre51
    40
21 an spe is a corporation
 trust or or entity organised for a specific purpose
         activities of which are limited to those appropriate to accomplish  purpose of         spe
 and  structure of which is intended to isolate  spe from  credit        risk of an originator or seller of exposures
 spes
 normally a trust or similar entity
        are commonly used as financing vehicles in which exposures are sold to  spe        in exchange for cash or or assets funded by debt issued by  trust
    40
22 for risk-based capital purposes
 tranche maturity 
mt
 is  tranches remaining         effective maturity in years and can be measured at  banks discretion in eir         of  following manners
 in all cases
 mt will have a floor of one year and a cap         of five years
           
1
 as  euro weighted-average maturity of  contractual cash flows of              tranche
 as expressed below
 where cft denotes  cash flows 
principal
              interest payments and fees
 contractually payable by  borrower in period              t
 the contractual payments must be unconditional and must not be              dependent on  actual performance of  securitised assets
 if such              unconditional contractual payment dates are not available
  final legal              maturity shall be used
           
2
 on  basis of final legal maturity of  tranche
 where ml is  final legal              maturity of  tranche
      the euro designation is used for illustrative purposes only
      40
23 when determining  maturity of a securitisation exposure
 banks should take        into account  maximum period of time y are exposed to potential losses        from  securitised assets
 in cases where a bank provides a commitment
         bank should calculate  maturity of  securitisation exposure resulting from        this commitment as  sum of  contractual maturity of  commitment and         longest maturity of  asset
s
 to which  bank would be exposed after a        draw has occurred
 if those assets are revolving
  longest contractually        possible remaining maturity of  asset  might be added during         revolving period would apply
 rar than  
longest
 maturity of  assets        currently in  pool
" the same treatment applies to all or instruments where         risk of  commitment/protection provider is not limited to losses realised        until  maturity of  instrument "
eg total return swaps
""
 for credit protection        instruments  are only exposed to losses  occur up to  maturity of         instrument
 a bank would be allowed to apply  contractual maturity of         instrument and would not have to look through to  protected position
      operational requirements for  recognition of risk transference  40
24 an originating bank may exclude underlying exposures from  calculation of        risk-weighted assets only if all of  following conditions have been met
 banks        meeting se conditions must still hold regulatory capital against any        securitisation exposures y retain
           
1
 significant credit risk associated with  underlying exposures has been             transferred to third parties
               
2
 the transferor does not maintain effective or indirect control over            transferred exposures
 the exposures are legally isolated from  transferor           in such a way 
eg through  sale of assets or through subparticipation
             exposures are put beyond  reach of  transferor and its creditors
           even in bankruptcy or receivership
 banks should obtain legal opinion            confirms true sale
 the transferors retention of servicing rights to                  exposures will not necessarily constitute indirect control of  exposures
           the transferor is deemed to have maintained effective control over            transferred credit risk exposures if it
             
a
 is able to repurchase from  transferee  previously transferred               exposures in order to realise ir benefits
 or             
b
 is obligated to retain  risk of  transferred exposures
         
3
 the securities issued are not obligations of  transferor
 thus
 investors           who purchase  securities only have claim to  underlying exposures
         
4
 the transferee is an spe and  holders of  beneficial interests in            entity have  right to pledge or exchange m without restriction
 unless           such restriction is imposed by a risk retention requirement
         
5
 clean-up calls must satisfy  conditions set out in cre40

6
 the securitisation does not contain clauses              
a
 require  originating bank to alter  underlying exposures such                 pools credit quality is improved unless this is achieved by selling               exposures to independent and unaffiliated third parties at market prices
             
b
 allow for increases in a retained first-loss position or credit               enhancement provided by  originating bank after  transactions               inception
 or             
c
   increase  yield payable to parties or than  originating bank
                 such as investors and third-party providers of credit enhancements
 in                 response to a deterioration in  credit quality of  underlying pool

 banks must transfer significant credit risk associated with  underlying             exposures to third parties
             
5
 the instruments used to transfer credit risk may not contain terms or             conditions  limit  amount of credit risk transferred
 such as those             provided below
               
a
 clauses  materially limit  credit protection or credit risk                 transference 
eg an early amortisation provision in a securitisation of                 revolving credit facilities  effectively subordinates  banks                 interest
 significant materiality thresholds below which credit protection                 is deemed not to be triggered even if a credit event occurs
 or clauses                  allow for  termination of  protection due to deterioration in                  credit quality of  underlying exposures
""

e
 clauses  provide for increases in a retained first-loss position or                 credit enhancement provided by  originating bank after                  transactions inception
           
6
 a bank should obtain legal opinion  confirms  enforceability of              contract
           
7
 clean-up calls must satisfy  conditions set out in cre40
28
    40
26 a securitisation transaction is deemed to fail  operational requirements set out        in cre40
24 or cre40
25 if  bank           
1
" originates/sponsors a securitisation transaction  includes one or more             revolving credit facilities"
 and                 
2
  securitisation transaction incorporates an early amortisation or similar             provision 
 if triggered
 would               
a
 subordinate  banks senior or pari passu interest in  underlying                 revolving credit facilities to  interest of or investors

 subordinate  banks subordinated interest to an even greater degree                 relative to  interests of or parties
 or                 
c
   in or ways increases  banks exposure to losses associated with                    underlying revolving credit facilities
    40
27 if a securitisation transaction contains one of  following examples of an early        amortisation provision and meets  operational requirements set forth in cre40
        24 or cre40
25
 an originating bank may exclude  underlying exposures        associated with such a transaction from  calculation of risk-weighted assets
        but must still hold regulatory capital against any securitisation exposures y        retain in connection with  transaction
           
1
 replenishment structures where  underlying exposures do not revolve and              early amortisation ends  ability of  bank to add new exposures
           
2
 transactions of revolving credit facilities containing early amortisation             features  mimic term structures 
ie where  risk on  underlying             revolving credit facilities does not return to  originating bank
 and where              early amortisation provision in a securitisation of revolving credit             facilities does not effectively result in subordination of  originators             interest
           
3
 structures where a bank securitises one or more revolving credit facilities and             where investors remain fully exposed to future drawdowns by borrowers             even after an early amortisation event has occurred
 or           
4
  early amortisation provision is solely triggered by events not related to              performance of  underlying assets or  selling bank
 such as             material changes in tax laws or regulations
    40
28 for securitisation transactions  include a clean-up call
 no capital will be        required due to  presence of a clean-up call if  following conditions are        met
           
1
  exercise of  clean-up call must not be mandatory
 in form or in             substance
 but rar must be at  discretion of  originating bank
           
2
  clean-up call must not be structured to avoid allocating losses to credit             enhancements or positions held by investors or orwise structured to             provide credit enhancement
 and           
3
  clean-up call must only be exercisable when 10% or less of  original             underlying portfolio or securities issued remains
 or
 for syntic             securitisations
 when 10% or less of  original reference portfolio value             remains
    40
29 securitisation transactions  include a clean-up call  does not meet all of         criteria stated in cre40
28 result in a capital requirement for  originating        bank
 for a traditional securitisation
  underlying exposures must be treated as        if y were not securitised
 additionally
 banks must not recognise in regulatory        capital any gain on sale
 in accordance with cap30
14
 for syntic        securitisations
  bank purchasing protection must hold capital against         entire amount of  securitised exposures as if y did not benefit from any        credit protection
 if a syntic securitisation incorporates a call 
or than a        clean-up call
  effectively terminates  transaction and  purchased credit        protection on a specific date
  bank must treat  transaction in accordance        with cre40
65
    40
30 if a clean-up call
 when exercised
 is found to serve as a credit enhancement
         exercise of  clean-up call must be considered a form of implicit support        provided by  bank and must be treated in accordance with  supervisory        guidance pertaining to securitisation transactions
      due diligence requirements  40
31 for a bank to use  risk weight approaches of  securitisation framework
 it        must have  information specified in cre40
32 to cre40
34
 orwise
         bank must assign a 1250% risk weight to any securitisation exposure for which it        cannot perform  required level of due diligence
    40
32 as a general rule
 a bank must
 on an ongoing basis
 have a comprehensive        understanding of  risk characteristics of its individual securitisation exposures
        wher on
or off-balance sheet
 as well as  risk characteristics of  pools        underlying its securitisation exposures
      40
33 banks must be able to access performance information on  underlying pools        on an ongoing basis in a timely manner
 such information may include
 as        appropriate
 exposure type
 percentage of loans 30
 60 and 90 days past due
        default rates
 prepayment rates
 loans in foreclosure
 property type
 occupancy
           average credit score or or measures of creditworthiness
 average loan-to
        value ratio
 and industry and geographical diversification
 for resecuritisations
         banks should have information not only on  underlying securitisation tranches
         such as  issuer name and credit quality
 but also on  characteristics and         performance of  pools underlying  securitisation tranches
    40
34 a bank must have a thorough understanding of all structural features of a        securitisation transaction  would materially impact  performance of         banks exposures to  transaction
 such as  contractual waterfall and        waterfall-related triggers
 credit enhancements
 liquidity enhancements
 market        value triggers
 and deal-specific definitions of default
      calculation of capital requirements and risk-weighted assets  40
35 regulatory capital is required for banks securitisation exposures
 including those        arising from  provision of credit risk mitigants to a securitisation transaction
        investments in asset-backed securities
 retention of a subordinated tranche
 and        extension of a liquidity facility or credit enhancement
 as set forth in  following        sections
 repurchased securitisation exposures must be treated as retained        securitisation exposures
    40
36 for  purposes of  expected loss 
el
 provision calculation set out in cre35
        securitisation exposures do not contribute to  el amount
 similarly
 neir        general nor specific provisions against securitisation exposures or underlying        assets still held on  balance sheet of  originator are to be included in         measurement of eligible provisions
 however
 originator banks can offset 1250%        risk-weighted securitisation exposures by reducing  securitisation exposure        amount by  amount of ir specific provisions on underlying assets of         transaction and non-refundable purchase price discounts on such underlying        assets
 specific provisions on securitisation exposures will be taken into account        in  calculation of  exposure amount
 as defined in cre40
19 and cre40
20
        general provisions on underlying securitised exposures are not to be taken into        account in any calculation
    40
37 the risk-weighted asset amount of a securitisation exposure is computed by        multiplying  exposure amount by  appropriate risk weight determined in        accordance with  hierarchy of approaches in cre40
41 to cre40
48
 risk        weight caps for senior exposures in accordance with cre40
50 and cre40
51 or        overall caps in accordance with cre40
52 to cre40
55 may apply
 overlapping        exposures will be risk-weighted as defined in cre40
38 and cre40
40
    40
38 for  purposes of calculating capital requirements
 a banks exposure a        overlaps anor exposure b if in all circumstances  bank will preclude any loss        for  bank on exposure b by fulfilling its obligations with respect to exposure a
        for example
 if a bank provides full credit support to some notes and holds a        portion of se notes
 its full credit support obligation precludes any loss from        its exposure to  notes
 if a bank can verify  fulfilling its obligations with        respect to exposure a will preclude a loss from its exposure to b under any        circumstance
  bank does not need to calculate risk-weighted assets for its        exposure b
    40
39 to arrive at an overlap
 a bank may
 for  purposes of calculating capital        requirements
 split or expand its exposures
 for example
 a liquidity facility may        not be contractually required to cover defaulted assets or may not fund an abcp        programme in certain circumstances
 for capital purposes
 such a situation would        not be regarded as an overlap to  notes issued by  abcp conduit
        however
  bank may calculate risk-weighted assets for  liquidity facility as if        it were expanded 
eir in order to cover defaulted assets or in terms of trigger        events
 to preclude all losses on  notes
 in such a case
  bank would only        need to calculate capital requirements on  liquidity facility      that is
 splitting exposures into portions  overlap with anor                     exposure held by  bank and or portions  do not overlap
 and                     expanding exposures by assuming for capital purposes  obligations                     with respect to one of  overlapping exposures are larger than those                     established contractually
 the latter could be done
 for instance
" by                     expanding eir  trigger events to exercise  facility and/or                      extent of  obligation"
      40
40 overlap could also be recognised between relevant capital charges for exposures        in  trading book and capital charges for exposures in  banking book
        provided   bank is able to calculate and compare  capital charges for         relevant exposures
      40
"41 securitisation exposures will be treated differently depending on  type of        underlying exposures and/or on  type of information available to  bank"
           securitisation exposures to which none of  approaches laid out in cre40
42 to         cre40
48 can be applied must be assigned a 1250% risk weight
    40
42 a bank must use  securitisation internal ratings-based approach 
sec-irba
        as described in cre44 for a securitisation exposure of an irb pool as defined in        cre40
15
 unless orwise determined by  supervisor
    40
43 if a bank cannot use  sec-irba
 it must use  securitisation external ratings
       based approach 
sec-erba
 as described in cre42
1 to cre42
7 for a        securitisation exposure to an sa pool as defined in cre40
17 provided            
1
  bank is located in a jurisdiction  permits use of  sec-erba and           
2
  exposure has an external credit assessment  meets  operational             requirements for an external credit assessment in cre42
8
 or re is an             inferred rating  meets  operational requirements for inferred ratings             in cre42
9 and cre42
10
    40
44 a bank  is located in a jurisdiction  permits use of  sec-erba may use        an internal assessment approach 
sec-iaa
 as described in cre43
1 to cre43
4        for an unrated securitisation exposure 
eg liquidity facilities and credit        enhancements
 to an sa pool within an abcp programme
 in order to use an sec
       iaa
 a bank must have supervisory approval to use  irb approach for non
       securitisation exposures
 a bank should consult with its national supervisor on        wher and when it can apply  sec-iaa to its securitisation exposures
        especially where  bank can apply  irb for some
 but not all
 underlying        exposures
 to ensure appropriate capital levels
 re may be instances where         supervisor requires a treatment or than this general rule
    40
45 a bank  cannot use  sec-erba or an sec-iaa for its exposure to an sa        pool may use  standardised approach 
sec-sa
 as described in cre41
1 to        cre41
15
    40
46 securitisation exposures of mixed pools
 where a bank can calculate kirb on at         least 95% of  underlying exposure amounts of a securitisation
  bank must         apply  sec-irba calculating  capital charge for  underlying pool as         follows
 where d is  percentage of  exposure amount of underlying         exposures for which  bank can calculate kirb over  exposure amount of all         underlying exposures
 and kirb and ksa are as defined in cre44
2 to cre44
5 and         cre41
2 to cre41
4
 respectively
    40
47 where  bank cannot calculate kirb on at least 95% of  underlying         exposures
  bank must use  hierarchy for securitisation exposures of sa         pools as set out in cre40
43 to cre40
45
    40
48 for resecuritisation exposures
 banks must apply  sec-sa
 with         adjustments in cre41
16
    40
49 when a bank provides implicit support to a securitisation
 it must
 at a minimum
        hold capital against all of  underlying exposures associated with         securitisation transaction as if y had not been securitised
 additionally
 banks        would not be permitted to recognise in regulatory capital any gain on sale
 in        accordance with cap30
14
      caps for securitisation exposures  40
50 banks may apply a look-through approach to senior securitisation exposures
        whereby  senior securitisation exposure could receive a maximum risk weight        equal to  exposure weighted-average risk weight applicable to  underlying        exposures
 provided   bank has knowledge of  composition of         underlying exposures at all times
 the applicable risk weight under  irb        framework would be calculated taking into account  application of  1
06        scaling factor pursuant to cre30
4
 and would also be inclusive of  expected        loss portion multiplied by 12
5
 in particular
           
1
 in  case of pools where  bank uses exclusively  sa or  irb             approach
  risk weight cap for senior exposures would equal  exposure             weighted-average risk weight  would apply to  underlying exposures             under  sa or irb framework
 respectively
           
2
 in  case of mixed pools
 when applying  sec-irba
  sa part of              underlying pool would receive  corresponding sa risk weight
 while              irb portion would receive irb risk weights
 when applying  sec-sa or              sec-erba
  risk weight cap for senior exposures would be based on              sa exposure weighted-average risk weight of  underlying assets
 wher             or not y are originally irb
    40

 in        assessing homogeneity
 consideration should be given to asset type
 jurisdiction
        legal system and currency
 as more exotic asset classes require more complex        and deeper analysis
 credit claims or receivables should have contractually        identified periodic payment streams relating to rental
 principal
 interest
 or        principal and interest payments
 any referenced interest payments or discount        rates should be based on commonly encountered market interest rates
 but        should not reference complex or complicated formulae or exotic derivatives
           
1
 for capital purposes
  homogeneity criterion should be assessed taking           into account  following principles
             
a
" the nature of assets should be such  investors would not need to               analyse and assess materially different legal and/or credit risk factors               and risk profiles when carrying out risk analysis and due diligence               checks"
             
b
 homogeneity should be assessed on  basis of common risk drivers
               including similar risk factors and risk profiles
                 
c
   credit claims or receivables included in  securitisation should have                 standard obligations
" in terms of rights to payments and/or income                 from assets and  result in a periodic and well-defined stream of                 payments to investors"
 credit card facilities should be deemed to result                 in a periodic and well-defined stream of payments to investors for                  purposes of this criterion
             
d
 repayment of noteholders should mainly rely on  principal and               interest proceeds from  securitised assets
 partial reliance on               refinancing or re-sale of  asset securing  exposure may occur               provided  re-financing is sufficiently distributed within  pool and                residual values on which  transaction relies are sufficiently low               and   reliance on refinancing is thus not substantial

 it is not              intention of  criteria to form an impediment to  entry of new             participants to  market
 but rar  investors should take into account              performance history of  asset class and  transaction parties when             deciding wher to invest in a securitisation

" the originator/sponsor of  securitisation"
 as well as  original lender             who underwrites  assets
 must have sufficient experience in originating             exposures similar to those securitised

" investors must             determine wher  performance history of  originator and  original             lender for substantially similar claims or receivables to those being             securitised has been established for an ""appropriately long period of time"

1
 to prevent credit claims or receivables arising from credit-impaired           borrowers from being transferred to  securitisation

d
  credit claim or receivable is not subject to a dispute between                 obligor and  original lender

100 the assets underlying a transaction in a conduit should be credit claims or        receivables  are homogeneous
 in terms of asset type
 the assets underlying        each individual transaction in a conduit should not be composed of        securitisation exposures as defined in cre40
4
 credit claims or receivables        underlying a transaction in a conduit should have contractually identified periodic        payment streams relating to rental
 principal
 interest
 or principal and interest        payments
 credit claims or receivables generating a single payment stream would        equally qualify as eligible
 any referenced interest payments or discount rates        should be based on commonly encountered market interest rates
 but should        not reference complex or complicated formulae or exotic derivatives
       for  avoidance of doubt
 this criterion does not automatically                     exclude securitisations of equipment leases and securitisations of auto                     loans and leases from  short-term stc framework
     payments on operating and financing lease are typically considered to                     be rental payments rar than payments of principal and interest
    commonly encountered market interest rates may include rates                     reflective of a lenders cost of funds

          additional guidance for criterion a1  40
101 the homogeneity criterion should be assessed taking into account         following principles
           
1
" the nature of assets should be such  re would be no need to analyse             and assess materially different legal and/or credit risk factors and risk             profiles when carrying out risk analysis and due diligence checks for              transaction"
           
2
 homogeneity should be assessed on  basis of common risk drivers
             including similar risk factors and risk profiles
           
3
 credit claims or receivables included in  securitisation should have             standard obligations
" in terms of rights to payments and/or income from             assets and  result in a periodic and well-defined stream of payments to             investors"
 credit card facilities should be deemed to result in a periodic and             well-defined stream of payments to investors for  purposes of this             criterion
           
4
 repayment of  securitisation exposure should mainly rely on  principal             and interest proceeds from  securitised assets
 partial reliance on             refinancing or re-sale of  asset securing  exposure may occur provided              re-financing is sufficiently distributed within  pool and  residual             values on which  transaction relies are sufficiently low and               reliance on refinancing is thus not substantial
    40
102 examples of commonly encountered market interest rates would include
           
1
 interbank rates and rates set by monetary policy authorities
 such as libor
             euribor and  fed funds rate
 and           
2
 sectoral rates reflective of a lenders cost of funds
 such as internal interest             rates  directly reflect  market costs of a banks funding or  of a             subset of institutions
    40
"103 interest rate caps and/or floors would not automatically be considered exotic        derivatives"
    40
104 the transaction level requirement is still met if  conduit does not purchase         underlying asset with a refundable purchase price discount but instead acquires a        beneficial interest in  form of a note which itself might qualify as a        securitisation exposure
 as long as  securitisation exposure is not subject to        any furr tranching 
ie has  same economic characteristic as  purchase of         underlying asset with a refundable purchase price discount

 to account for tranche maturity
 banks shall use linear interpolation between              risk weights for one and five years
           
2
 to account for tranche thickness
 banks shall calculate  risk weight for non
            senior tranches as follows
 where t equals tranche thickness
 and is measured as d             minus a
 as defined
 respectively

  risk         weight will be inferred from a securitisation exposure  is pari passu to          swaps or
 if such an exposure does not exist
 from  next subordinated tranche
    42
7   the resulting risk weight is subject to a floor risk weight of 15%
 in addition
          resulting risk weight should never be lower than  risk weight corresponding to         a senior tranche of  same securitisation with  same rating and maturity
      operational requirements for use of external credit assessments  42
8   the following operational criteria concerning  use of external credit         assessments apply in  securitisation framework
           
1
 to be eligible for risk-weighting purposes
  external credit assessment             must take into account and reflect  entire amount of credit risk exposure              bank has with regard to all payments owed to it
 for example
 if a bank is             owed both principal and interest
  assessment must fully take into             account and reflect  credit risk associated with timely repayment of both             principal and interest
           
2
 the external credit assessments must be from an eligible external credit             assessment institution 
ecai
 as recognised by  banks national supervisor             in accordance with cre21 with  following exception
 in contrast with             cre21
2
3
""
 an eligible credit assessment
 procedures
 methodologies
             assumptions and  key elements underlying  assessments must be             publicly available
 on a non-selective basis and free of charge
 in or             words
 a rating must be published in an accessible form and included in              ecais transition matrix
 also
 loss and cash flow analysis as well as sensitivity             of ratings to changes in  underlying rating assumptions should be             publicly available
 consequently
 ratings  are made available only to              parties to a transaction do not satisfy this requirement
           
3
 eligible ecais must have a demonstrated expertise in assessing             securitisations
 which may be evidenced by strong market acceptance
               
4
 where two or more eligible ecais can be used and se assess  credit           risk of  same securitisation exposure differently
 cre21
6 to cre21
8 will           apply
         
5
 where credit risk mitigation 
crm
 is provided to specific underlying           exposures or  entire pool by an eligible guarantor as defined in cre22           and is reflected in  external credit assessment assigned to a securitisation           exposure
s
""
  risk weight associated with  external credit assessment           should be used
 in order to avoid any double-counting
 no additional capital           recognition is permitted
 if  crm provider is not recognised as an eligible           guarantor under cre22
  covered securitisation exposures should be           treated as unrated
         
6
 in  situation where a credit risk mitigant solely protects a specific           securitisation exposure within a given structure 
eg asset-backed security           tranche
 and this protection is reflected in  external credit assessment
            bank must treat  exposure as if it is unrated and n apply  crm           treatment outlined in cre22 or in  foundation internal ratings-based 
irb
           approach of cre30 to cre36
 to recognise  hedge
         
7
 a bank is not permitted to use any external credit assessment for risk
          weighting purposes where  assessment is at least partly based on           unfunded support provided by  bank
 for example
 if a bank buys asset
          backed commercial paper 
abcp
 where it provides an unfunded           securitisation exposure extended to  abcp programme 
eg liquidity           facility or credit enhancement
""
 and  exposure plays a role in determining            credit assessment on  abcp
  bank must treat  abcp as if it           were not rated
 the bank must continue to hold capital against  or           securitisation exposures it provides 
"eg against  liquidity facility and/or           credit enhancement"
""
       where  eligible credit assessment is not publicly available free of                   charge
  ecai should provide an adequate justification
 within its                   own publicly available code of conduct
 in accordance with  comply                   or explain nature of  international organization of securities                   commissions code of conduct fundamentals for credit rating                   agencies
          operational requirements for inferred ratings  42
9   in accordance with  hierarchy of approaches determined in cre40
41 to cre40
         47
 a bank must infer a rating for an unrated position and use  sec-erba         provided   requirements set out in cre42
10 are met
 these requirements         are intended to ensure   unrated position is pari passu or senior in all         respects to an externally-rated securitisation exposure termed  reference         securitisation exposure
    42
10 the following operational requirements must be satisfied to recognise inferred        ratings
           
1
 the reference securitisation exposure 
eg asset-backed security
 must rank             pari passu or be subordinate in all respects to  unrated securitisation             exposure
 credit enhancements
 if any
 must be taken into account when             assessing  relative subordination of  unrated exposure and              reference securitisation exposure
 for example
 if  reference securitisation             exposure benefits from any third-party guarantees or or credit             enhancements  are not available to  unrated exposure
 n  latter             may not be assigned an inferred rating based on  reference securitisation             exposure
           
2
 the maturity of  reference securitisation exposure must be equal to or             longer than  of  unrated exposure
           
3
 on an ongoing basis
 any inferred rating must be updated continuously to             reflect any subordination of  unrated position or changes in  external             rating of  reference securitisation exposure
           
4
 the external rating of  reference securitisation exposure must satisfy              general requirements for recognition of external ratings as delineated in             cre42

1   subject to supervisory approval
 a bank may use its internal assessments of          credit quality of its securitisation exposures extended to abcp programmes 
eg         liquidity facilities and credit enhancements
 provided   bank has at least         one approved irb model 
which does not need to be applicable to  securitised         exposures
 and if  bank  internal assessment process meets  operational         requirements set out below
 internal assessments of exposures provided to abcp         programmes must be mapped to equivalent external ratings of an ecai
 those         rating equivalents are used to determine  appropriate risk weights under          sec-erba for  exposures
    43
2   a bank  internal assessment process must meet  following operational         requirements in order to use internal assessments in determining  irb capital         requirement arising from liquidity facilities
 credit enhancements
 or or         exposures extended to an abcp programme
           
1
 for  unrated exposure to qualify for  internal assessment approach             
sec-iaa
""
  abcp must be externally rated
 the abcp itself is subject to              sec-erba
           
2
 the internal assessment of  credit quality of a securitisation exposure to              abcp programme must be based on ecai criteria for  asset type             purchased
 and must be  equivalent of at least investment grade when             initially assigned to an exposure
 in addition
  internal assessment must             be used in  bank  internal risk management processes
 including             management information and economic capital systems
 and generally must             meet all  relevant requirements of  irb framework
           
3
 in order for banks to use  sec-iaa
 ir supervisors must be satisfied               
a
   ecai meets  ecai eligibility criteria outlined in cre21 and               
b
 with  ecai rating methodologies used in  process
           
4
 banks demonstrate to  satisfaction of ir supervisors how se internal             assessments correspond to  relevant ecai  standards
 for instance
 when             calculating  credit enhancement level in  context of  sec-iaa
             supervisors may
 if warranted
 disallow on a full or partial basis any seller
            provided recourse guarantees or excess spread
 or any or first-loss credit             enhancements  provide limited protection to  bank
               
5
 the bank  internal assessment process must identify gradations of risk
           internal assessments must correspond to  external ratings of ecais so            supervisors can determine which internal assessment corresponds to           each external rating category of  ecais
               
6
 the bank  internal assessment process
 particularly  stress factors for           determining credit enhancement requirements
 must be at least as           conservative as  publicly available rating criteria of  major ecais            are externally rating  abcp programme  commercial paper for  asset           type being purchased by  programme
 however
 banks should consider
           to some extent
 all publicly available ecai rating methodologies in           developing ir internal assessments
             
a
 in  case where  commercial paper issued by an abcp programme               is externally rated by two or more ecais and  different ecais
              benchmark stress factors require different levels of credit enhancement               to achieve  same external rating equivalent
  bank must apply                ecai stress factor  requires  most conservative or highest level of               credit protection
 for example
 if one ecai required enhancement of 2
5               to 3
5 times historical losses for an asset type to obtain a single a rating               equivalent and anor required two to three times historical losses
                bank must use  higher range of stress factors in determining                appropriate level of seller-provided credit enhancement
             
b
 when selecting ecais to externally rate an abcp
 a bank must not               choose only those ecais  generally have relatively less restrictive               rating methodologies
 in addition
 if re are changes in                methodology of one of  selected ecais
 including  stress factors
                adversely affect  external rating of  programme  commercial               paper
 n  revised rating methodology must be considered in               evaluating wher  internal assessments assigned to abcp               programme exposures are in need of revision
             
c
   a bank cannot utilise an ecai  rating methodology to derive an internal                 assessment if  ecai  process or rating criteria are not publicly                 available
 however
 banks should consider  non-publicly available                 methodology 
to  extent  y have access to such information 
                in developing ir internal assessments
 particularly if it is more                 conservative than  publicly available criteria
             
d
 in general
 if  ecai rating methodologies for an asset or exposure are               not publicly available
 n  iaa may not be used
 however
 in                 certain instances 
for example
 for new or uniquely structured                 transactions
 which are not currently addressed by  rating criteria of                 an ecai rating  programme  commercial paper 
a bank may discuss                  specific transaction with its supervisor to determine wher  iaa                 may be applied to  related exposures

 internal or external auditors
 an ecai
 or  bank  internal credit review or           risk management function must perform regular reviews of  internal             assessment process and assess  validity of those internal assessments
 if            bank  internal audit
 credit review or risk management functions           perform  reviews of  internal assessment process
 n se functions           must be independent of  abcp programme business line
 as well as            underlying customer relationships
         
8
 the bank must track  performance of its internal assessments over time to           evaluate  performance of  assigned internal assessments and make           adjustments
 as necessary
 to its assessment process when  performance           of  exposures routinely diverges from  assigned internal assessments           on those exposures
         
9
 the abcp programme must have credit and investment guidelines
 ie           underwriting standards
 for  abcp programme
 in  consideration of an           asset purchase
  abcp programme 
ie  programme administrator
           should develop an outline of  structure of  purchase transaction
           factors  should be discussed include  type of asset being purchased
           type and monetary value of  exposures arising from  provision of           liquidity facilities and credit enhancements
 loss waterfall
 and legal and           economic isolation of  transferred assets from  entity selling  assets
         
10
 a credit analysis of  asset seller  risk profile must be performed and            should consider
 for example
 past and expected future financial            performance
 current market position
 expected future competitiveness
            leverage
 cash flow and interest coverage
 and debt rating
 in addition
 a            review of  seller  underwriting standards
 servicing capabilities and            collection processes should be performed
         
11
 the abcp programme  underwriting policy must establish minimum asset            eligibility criteria 
 among or things
               
a
 exclude  purchase of assets  are significantly past due or                 defaulted
               
b
 limit excess concentration to individual obligor or geographical area
                 and               
c
   limit  tenor of  assets to be purchased
                 
12
 the abcp programme should have collection processes established               consider  operational capability and credit quality of  servicer
" the              programme should mitigate to  extent possible seller/servicer risk              through various methods"
 such as triggers based on current credit quality               would preclude commingling of funds and impose lockbox              arrangements  would help ensure  continuity of payments to               abcp programme
           
13
 the aggregate estimate of loss on an asset pool   abcp programme              is considering purchasing must consider all sources of potential risk
 such              as credit and dilution risk
 if  seller-provided credit enhancement is sized              based on only credit-related losses
 n a separate reserve should be              established for dilution risk
 if dilution risk is material for  particular              exposure pool
 in addition
 in sizing  required enhancement level
               bank should review several years of historical information
 including losses
              delinquencies
 dilutions and  turnover rate of  receivables
              furrmore
  bank should evaluate  characteristics of  underlying              asset pool 
eg weighted-average credit score
 and should identify any              concentrations to an individual obligor or geographical region and               granularity of  asset pool
           
14
 the abcp programme must incorporate structural features into               purchase of assets in order to mitigate potential credit deterioration of               underlying portfolio
 such features may include wind-down triggers specific              to a pool of exposures
    43
3   the exposure amount of  securitisation exposure to  abcp programme         must be assigned to  risk weight in  sec-erba appropriate to  credit         rating equivalent assigned to  bank  exposure
    43
4   if a bank  internal assessment process is no longer considered adequate
          bank  supervisor may preclude  bank from applying  sec-iaa to its abcp         exposures
 both existing and newly originated
 for determining  appropriate         capital treatment until  bank has remedied  deficiencies
 in this instance
          bank must revert to  sec-sa described in cre41

13 securities financing transactions 
sfts
 are transactions such as repurchase        agreements
 reverse repurchase agreements
 security lending and borrowing
 and        margin lending transactions
 where  value of  transactions depends on        market valuations and  transactions are often subject to margin agreements
    50
14 margin lending transactions are transactions in which a bank extends credit in        connection with  purchase
 sale
 carrying or trading of securities
 margin        lending transactions do not include or loans  happen to be secured by        securities collateral
 generally
 in margin lending transactions
  loan amount is        collateralised by securities whose value is greater than  amount of  loan
      netting sets
 hedging sets
 and related terms  50
15 netting set is a group of transactions with a single counterparty  are subject        to a legally enforceable bilateral netting arrangement and for which netting is        recognised for regulatory capital purposes under  provisions of cre52
7 and        cre52
8  are applicable to  group of transactions

 each transaction  is not subject to a legally        enforceable bilateral netting arrangement  is recognised for regulatory capital        purposes should be interpreted as its own netting set for  purpose of se        rules
    50
16 hedging set is a set of transactions within a single netting set within which full or        partial offsetting is recognised for  purpose of calculating  pfe add-on of         standardised approach for counterparty credit risk
    50
17 margin agreement is a contractual agreement or provisions to an agreement        under which one counterparty must supply variation margin to a second        counterparty when an exposure of  second counterparty to  first        counterparty exceeds a specified level
    50
18 margin threshold is  largest amount of an exposure  remains outstanding        until one party has  right to call for variation margin
    50
19 margin period of risk is  time period from  last exchange of collateral        covering a netting set of transactions with a defaulting counterparty until         counterparty is closed out and  resulting market risk is re-hedged
    50
20 effective maturity under  internal models method for a netting set with        maturity greater than one year is  ratio of  sum of expected exposure over         life of  transactions in a netting set discounted at  risk-free rate of        return divided by  sum of expected exposure over one year in a netting set        discounted at  risk-free rate
 this effective maturity may be adjusted to reflect        rollover risk by replacing expected exposure with effective expected exposure for        forecasting horizons under one year
 the formula is given in cre53
20
    50
21 cross-product netting refers to  inclusion of transactions of different product        categories within  same netting set pursuant to  cross-product netting        rules set out in cre53
      distributions  50
22 distribution of market values is  forecast of  probability distribution of        net market values of transactions within a netting set for some future date 
        forecasting horizon
 given  realised market value of those transactions up to         present time
    50
23 distribution of exposures is  forecast of  probability distribution of        market values  is generated by setting forecast instances of negative net        market values equal to zero 
this takes account of  fact 
 when  bank        owes  counterparty money
  bank does not have an exposure to         counterparty
""
    50
24 risk-neutral distribution is a distribution of market values or exposures at a        future time period where  distribution is calculated using market implied        values such as implied volatilities
          50
25 actual distribution is a distribution of market values or exposures at a future        time period where  distribution is calculated using historic or realised values        such as volatilities calculated using past price or rate changes
      exposure measures and adjustments  50
26 current exposure is  larger of zero
 or  current market value of a        transaction or portfolio of transactions within a netting set with a counterparty         would be lost upon  immediate default of  counterparty
 assuming no        recovery on  value of those transactions in bankruptcy
 current exposure is        often also called replacement cost
    50
27 peak exposure is a high percentile 
typically 95% or 99%
 of  distribution of        exposures at any particular future date before  maturity date of  longest        transaction in  netting set
 a peak exposure value is typically generated for        many future dates up until  longest maturity date of transactions in         netting set
    50
28 expected exposure is  mean 
average
 of  distribution of exposures at any        particular future date before  longest-maturity transaction in  netting set        matures
 an expected exposure value is typically generated for many future dates        up until  longest maturity date of transactions in  netting set
    50
29 effective expected exposure at a specific date is  maximum expected        exposure  occurs at  date or any prior date
 alternatively
 it may be        defined for a specific date as  greater of  expected exposure at  date
 or         effective exposure at  previous date

30 expected positive exposure 
epe
 is  weighted average over time of        expected exposure where  weights are  proportion  an individual        expected exposure represents of  entire time interval
 when calculating         minimum capital requirement
  average is taken over  first year or
 if all         contracts in  netting set mature before one year

       maturity contract in  netting set where  weights are  proportion  an        individual expected exposure represents of  entire time interval
      50
32 credit valuation adjustment is an adjustment to  mid-market valuation of         portfolio of trades with a counterparty
 this adjustment reflects  market         value of  credit risk due to any failure to perform on contractual agreements         with a counterparty
 this adjustment may reflect  market value of  credit         risk of  counterparty or  market value of  credit risk of both  bank         and  counterparty
    50
33 one-sided credit valuation adjustment is a credit valuation adjustment         reflects  market value of  credit risk of  counterparty to  firm
 but        does not reflect  market value of  credit risk of  bank to         counterparty
      ccr-related risks  50
34 rollover risk is  amount by which expected positive exposure is understated        when future transactions with a counterparty are expected to be conducted on an        ongoing basis
 but  additional exposure generated by those future        transactions is not included in calculation of expected positive exposure

35 general wrong-way risk arises when  probability of default of counterparties        is positively correlated with general market risk factors
    50
36 specific wrong-way risk arises when  exposure to a particular counterparty is        positively correlated with  probability of default of  counterparty due to         nature of  transactions with  counterparty

    introduction  51
1   banks are required to identify ir transactions  expose m to counterparty         credit risk and calculate a counterparty credit risk charge
 this chapter starts by         explaining  definition of counterparty credit risk
 it n sets out  various         approaches  banks can use to measure ir counterparty credit risk         exposures and n calculate  related capital requirement
      counterparty credit risk definition and explanation  51
2   counterparty credit risk is defined in cre50
 it is  risk   counterparty to         a transaction could default before  final settlement of  transaction in cases         where re is a bilateral risk of loss
 the bilateral risk of loss is  key concept         on which  definition of counterparty credit risk is based and is explained         furr below
    51
3   when a bank makes a loan to a borrower  credit risk exposure is unilateral
         that is
  bank is exposed to  risk of loss arising from  default of          borrower
 but  transaction does not expose  borrower to a risk of loss from          default of  bank
 by contrast
 some transactions give rise to a bilateral risk         of loss and refore give rise to a counterparty credit risk charge
 for example
           
1
 a bank makes a loan to a borrower and receives collateral from  borrower
                              
a
 the bank is exposed to  risk   borrower defaults and  sale                 of  collateral is insufficient to cover  loss on  loan
               
b
 the borrower is exposed to  risk   bank defaults and does not                 return  collateral
 even in cases where  customer has  legal                 right to offset  amount it owes on  loan in compensation for                  lost collateral
  customer is still exposed to  risk of loss at                  outset of  loan because  value of  loan may be less than                  value of  collateral  time of default of  bank
           
2
 a bank borrows cash from a counterparty and posts collateral to            counterparty 
or undertakes a transaction  is economically equivalent
           such as  sale and repurchase 
repo
 of a security
""
             
a
 the bank is exposed to  risk  its counterparty defaults and does               not return  collateral   bank posted
             
b
 the counterparty is exposed to  risk   bank defaults and                amount  counterparty raises from  sale of  collateral                    bank posted is insufficient to cover  loss on  counterpartys loan                to  bank
         
3
 a bank borrows a security from a counterparty and posts cash to            counterparty as collateral 
or undertakes a transaction  is economically           equivalent
 such as a reverse repo
""
             
a
 the bank is exposed to  risk  its counterparty defaults and does               not return  cash   bank posted as collateral
             
b
 the counterparty is exposed to  risk   bank defaults and                cash   bank posted as collateral is insufficient to cover  loss of                security   bank borrowed
         
4
 a bank enters a derivatives transaction with a counterparty 
eg it enters a           swap transaction or purchases an option
""
 the value of  transaction can           vary over time with  movement of underlying market factors
             
a
 the bank is exposed to  risk   counterparty defaults when                derivative has a positive value for  bank
             
b
 the counterparty is exposed to  risk   bank defaults when                derivative has a positive value for  counterparty
           the bilateral risk of loss in this example arises because  bank                     receives
 ie takes possession of
  collateral as part of  transaction
                     by contrast
 collateralized loans where  collateral is not exchanged                     prior to default
 do not give rise to a bilateral risk of loss
 for example a                     corporate or retail loan secured on a property of  borrower where                      bank may only take possession of  property when  borrower                     defaults does not give rise to counterparty credit risk
     the counterparty credit risk rules capture  risk of loss to  bank                     from  default of  derivative counterparty
 the risk of gains or                     losses on  changing market value of  derivative is captured by                      market risk framework
 the market risk framework captures                      risk   bank will suffer a loss as a result of market movements in                     underlying risk factors referenced by  derivative 
eg interest rates for                     an interest rate swap
""
 however
 it also captures  risk of losses                      can result from  derivative declining in value due to a deterioration                     in  creditworthiness of  derivative counterparty
 the latter risk is                      credit valuation adjustment risk set out in mar50

4
 the transactions are undertaken with an identified counterparty against             which a unique probability of default can be determined
    51
6   or common characteristics of  transactions listed in cre51
4 include          following
           
1
 collateral may be used to mitigate risk exposure and is inherent in  nature             of some transactions
           
2
 short-term financing may be a primary objective in   transactions             mostly consist of an exchange of one asset for anor 
cash or securities
             for a relatively short period of time
 usually for  business purpose of             financing
 the two sides of  transactions are not  result of separate             decisions but form an indivisible whole to accomplish a defined objective

  ead may be capped to                     amount of unpaid premia
 banks have  option to remove such                    credit derivatives from ir legal netting sets and treat m as                    individual unmargined transactions in order to apply  cap
           faq3       are banks permitted to decompose certain types of products for which                    no specific treatment is specified in  sa-ccr standard into several                    simpler contracts resulting in  same cash flows?                      in  case of options

2   the replacement cost 
rc
 and  potential future exposure 
pfe
 components         are calculated differently for margined and unmargined netting sets
 margined         netting sets are netting sets covered by a margin agreement under which          banks counterparty has to post variation margin
 all or netting sets
 including         those covered by a one-way margin agreement where only  bank posts         variation margin
 are treated as unmargined for  purposes of  sa-ccr
 the         ead for a margined netting set is capped at  ead of  same netting set         calculated on an unmargined basis
             faq         faq1       the capping of  exposure at default 
ead
 at  orwise                    unmargined ead is motivated by  need to ignore exposure from a                    large threshold amount  would not realistically be hit by some                    small 
or non-existent
 transactions
 there is
 however
 a potential                    anomaly relating to this capping
 namely in  case of margined                    netting sets comprising short-term transactions with a residual                    maturity of 10 business days or less
 in this situation
  maturity                    factor 
mf
 weighting will be greater for a margined set than for a non
                   margined set
" because of  3/2 multiplier in cre52"
52
 that                    multiplier will
 however
 be negated by  capping
 the anomaly                    would be magnified if re were some disputes under  margin                    agreement
 ie where  margin period or risk 
mpor
 would be                    doubled to 20 days but
 again
 negated by  capping to an                    unmargined calculation
 does this anomaly exist?                      yes
 such an anomaly does exist
 noneless
 this anomaly is                    generally expected to have no significant impact on banks capital                    requirements
 thus
 no modification to  standard is required
        replacement cost and net independent collateral amount  52

 the pfe add-on represents a potential conservative increase in         exposure over a one-year time horizon from  present date 
ie  calculation         date
""
        52
4           for margined trades
  rc intends to capture  loss  would occur if a         counterparty were to default at  present or at a future time
 assuming           closeout and replacement of transactions occur instantaneously
 however
 re         may be a period 
 margin period of risk
 between  last exchange of         collateral before default and replacement of  trades in  market
 the pfe         add-on represents  potential change in value of  trades during this time         period
    52
5   in both cases
  haircut applicable to noncash collateral in  replacement cost         formulation represents  potential change in value of  collateral during          appropriate time period 
one year for unmargined trades and  margin period         of risk for margined trades
""
    52
6   replacement cost is calculated at  netting set level
 whereas pfe add-ons are         calculated for each asset class within a given netting set and n aggregated

7   for capital adequacy purposes
 banks may net transactions 
eg when determining          rc component of a netting set
 subject to novation under which any         obligation between a bank and its counterparty to deliver a given currency on a         given value date is automatically amalgamated with all or obligations for          same currency and value date
 legally substituting one single amount for          previous gross obligations
 banks may also net transactions subject to any legally         valid form of bilateral netting not covered in  preceding sentence
 including         or forms of novation
 in every such case where netting is applied
 a bank must         satisfy its national supervisor  it has
           
1
 a netting contract with  counterparty or or agreement which creates a             single legal obligation
 covering all included transactions
 such   bank             would have eir a claim to receive or obligation to pay only  net sum of              positive and negative mark-to-market values of included individual             transactions in  event a counterparty fails to perform due to any of              following
 default
 bankruptcy
 liquidation or similar circumstances
             
2
 written and reasoned legal reviews 
 in  event of a legal challenge
              relevant courts and administrative authorities would find  banks exposure             to be such a net amount under
               
a
 the law of  jurisdiction in which  counterparty is chartered and
 if                  foreign branch of a counterparty is involved
 n also under  law                 of  jurisdiction in which  branch is located
               
b
 the law  governs  individual transactions
 and                 
c
   the law  governs any contract or agreement necessary to effect                    netting
           
3
 procedures in place to ensure   legal characteristics of netting             arrangements are kept under review in light of  possible changes in             relevant law
     the netting contract must not contain any clause which
 in  event of                     default of a counterparty
 permits a non-defaulting counterparty to                     make limited payments only
 or no payments at all
 to  estate of                      defaulting party
 even if  defaulting party is a net creditor
      52
8   the national supervisor
 after consultation when necessary with or relevant         supervisors
 must be satisfied   netting is enforceable under  laws of         each of  relevant jurisdictions
 thus
 if any of se supervisors is dissatisfied         about enforceability under its laws
  netting contract or agreement will not         meet this condition and neir counterparty could obtain supervisory benefit
    52
9   there are two formulations of replacement cost depending on wher  trades         with a counterparty are margined or unmargined
 the margined formulation         could apply both to bilateral transactions and to central clearing relationships
"         the formulation also addresses  various arrangements  a bank may have         to post and/or receive collateral  may be referred to as initial margin"
        formulation for unmargined transactions  52
10 for unmargined transactions
 rc is defined as  greater of
 
i
  current        market value of  derivative contracts less net haircut collateral held by         bank 
if any
""
 and 
ii
 zero
 this is consistent with  use of replacement cost as         measure of current exposure
 meaning  when  bank owes         counterparty money it has no exposure to  counterparty if it can instantly        replace its trades and sell collateral at current market prices
 the formula for rc is        as follows
 where
           
1
 v is  value of  derivative transactions in  netting set           
2
 c is  haircut value of net collateral held
 which is calculated in accordance             with  net independent collateral amount 
nica
 methodology defined in             cre52
17         as set out in cre52
2
 netting sets  include a one-way margin                     agreement in favour of  banks counterparty 
ie  bank posts
 but                     does not receive variation margin
 are treated as unmargined for                      purposes of sa-ccr
 for such netting sets
 c also includes
 with a                     negative sign
  variation margin amount posted by  bank to                      counterparty
             faq         faq1        how must banks calculate  haircut applicable in  replacement                     cost calculation for unmargined trades?                       the haircut applicable in  replacement cost calculation for                     unmargined trades should follow  formula in cre22
63
 in applying                      formula
 banks must use  maturity of  longest transaction in                      netting set as  value for nr
 capped at 250 days
 in order to                     scale haircuts for unmargined trades
 which is capped at 100%
          52
11 for  purpose of cre52
10 above
  value of non-cash collateral posted by         bank to its counterparty is increased and  value of  non-cash collateral        received by  bank from its counterparty is decreased using haircuts 
which are         same as those  apply to repo-style transactions
 for  time periods        described in cre52
5 above
    52
12 the formulation set out in cre52
10 above
 does not permit  replacement        cost
 which represents todays exposure to  counterparty
 to be less than zero
        however
 banks sometimes hold excess collateral 
even in  absence of a        margin agreement
 or have out-of--money trades which can furr protect         bank from  increase of  exposure
 as discussed in cre52
21 to cre52
23        below
  sa-ccr allows such over-collateralisation and negative mark-to
       market value to reduce pfe
 but y are not permitted to reduce replacement        cost
      formulation for margined transactions  52
13 the rc formula for margined transactions builds on  rc formula for        unmargined transactions
 it also employs concepts used in standard margining        agreements
 as discussed more fully below
    52
14 the rc for margined transactions in  sa-ccr is defined as  greatest        exposure  would not trigger a call for vm
 taking into account  mechanics        of collateral exchanges in margining agreements
 such mechanics include
 for        example
 threshold
 minimum transfer amount and independent amount in         standard industry documentation
 which are factored into a call for vm
 a        defined
 generic formulation has been created to reflect  variety of margining        approaches used and those being considered by supervisors internationally
           see cre99 for illustrative examples of  effect of standard margin                    agreements on  sa-ccr formulation
    for example
  1992 
multicurrency-cross border
 master agreement                    and  2002 master agreement published by  international swaps                    & derivatives association

      for example
 in  isda master agreement
  term credit support                    amount
 or  overall amount of collateral  must be delivered                    between  parties
 is defined as  greater of  secured partys                    exposure plus  aggregate of all independent amounts applicable to                     pledgor minus all independent amounts applicable to  secured                    party
 minus  pledgors threshold and zero
        incorporating nica into replacement cost  52
15 one objective of  sa-ccr is to reflect  effect of margining agreements and         associated exchange of collateral in  calculation of ccr exposures
 the        following paragraphs address how  exchange of collateral is incorporated into         sa-ccr
    52
16 to avoid confusion surrounding  use of terms initial margin and independent        amount which are used in various contexts and sometimes interchangeably
         term independent collateral amount 
ica
 is introduced
 ica represents
 
i
        collateral 
or than vm
 posted by  counterparty   bank may seize        upon default of  counterparty
"  amount of which does not change in        response to  value of  transactions it secures and/or "
ii
  independent        amount 
ia
 parameter as defined in standard industry documentation
 ica can        change in response to factors such as  value of  collateral or a change in         number of transactions in  netting set
          52
17 because both a bank and its counterparty may be required to post ica
 it is        necessary to introduce a companion term
 net independent collateral amount        
nica
""
 to describe  amount of collateral  a bank may use to offset its        exposure on  default of  counterparty
 nica does not include collateral         a bank has posted to a segregated
 bankruptcy remote account
 which        presumably would be returned upon  bankruptcy of  counterparty
 that is
        nica represents any collateral 
segregated or unsegregated
 posted by            counterparty less  unsegregated collateral posted by  bank
 with respect to         ia
 nica takes into account  differential of ia required for  bank minus ia         required for  counterparty
    52
18 for margined trades
  replacement cost is calculated using  following        formula
 where
           
1
 v and c are defined as in  unmargined formulation
 except  c now             includes  net variation margin amount
 where  amount received by              bank is accounted with a positive sign and  amount posted by  bank is             accounted with a negative sign           
2
 th is  positive threshold before  counterparty must send  bank             collateral           
3
 mta is  minimum transfer amount applicable to  counterparty        52
19 th 
 mta  nica represents  largest exposure  would not trigger a vm        call and it contains levels of collateral  need always to be maintained
 for        example
 without initial margin or ia
  greatest exposure  would not        trigger a variation margin call is  threshold plus any minimum transfer        amount
 in  adapted formulation
 nica is subtracted from th 
 mta
" this        makes  calculation more accurate by fully reflecting both  actual level of        exposure  would not trigger a margin call and  effect of collateral held and        /or posted by a bank"
 the calculation is floored at zero
 recognising   bank        may hold nica in excess of th 
 mta
 which could orwise result in a negative        replacement cost
      pfe add-on for each netting set  52
20 the pfe add-on consists of
 
i
 an aggregate add-on component
 and 
ii
 a        multiplier  allows for  recognition of excess collateral or negative mark-to
       market value for  transactions within  netting set
 the formula for pfe is as        follows
 where
             
1
 addonaggregate is  aggregate add-on component 
see cre52
25 below
           
2
 multiplier is defined as a function of three inputs
 v
 c and addonaggregate          multiplier 
recognition of excess collateral and negative mark-to
 market 
  52
21 as a general principle
 over-collateralisation should reduce capital requirements        for counterparty credit risk
 in fact
 many banks hold excess collateral 
ie collateral        greater than  net market value of  derivatives contracts
 precisely to offset        potential increases in exposure represented by  add-on
 as discussed in cre52
        10 and cre52
18
 collateral may reduce  replacement cost component of         exposure under  sa-ccr
 the pfe component also reflects  risk-reducing        property of excess collateral
    52
22 for prudential reasons
  basel committee decided to apply a multiplier to         pfe component  decreases as excess collateral increases
 without reaching        zero 
 multiplier is floored at 5% of  pfe add-on
""
 when  collateral held        is less than  net market value of  derivative contracts 
under
       collateralisation
""
  current replacement cost is positive and  multiplier is        equal to one 
ie  pfe component is equal to  full value of  aggregate        add-on
""
 where  collateral held is greater than  net market value of         derivative contracts 
over-collateralisation
""
  current replacement cost is zero        and  multiplier is less than one 
ie  pfe component is less than  full        value of  aggregate add-on
""
    52
23 this multiplier will also be activated when  current value of  derivative        transactions is negative
 this is because out-of--money transactions do not        currently represent an exposure and have less chance to go in--money
 the        formula for  multiplier is as follows
 where
           
1
 exp
""
 is  exponential function           
2
 floor is 5%           
3
 v is  value of  derivative transactions in  netting set           
4
 c is  haircut value of net collateral held      aggregate add-on and asset classes  52
24 to calculate  aggregate add-on
 banks must calculate add-ons for each asset        class within  netting set
 the sa-ccr uses  following five asset classes
           
1
 interest rate derivatives           
2
 foreign exchange derivatives           
3
 credit derivatives           
4
 equity derivatives
           
5
 commodity derivatives    52
25 diversification benefits across asset classes are not recognised
 instead
         respective add-ons for each asset class are simply aggregated using  following        formula 
where  sum is across  asset classes
""
          allocation of derivative transactions to one or more asset classes  52
26 the designation of a derivative transaction to an asset class is to be made on         basis of its primary risk driver
 most derivative transactions have one primary risk        driver
 defined by its reference underlying instrument 
eg an interest rate curve        for an interest rate swap
 a reference entity for a credit default swap
 a foreign        exchange rate for a foreign exchange 
fx
 call option
 etc
""
 when this primary risk        driver is clearly identifiable
  transaction will fall into one of  asset classes        described above
    52
27 for more complex trades  may have more than one risk driver 
eg multi-asset        or hybrid derivatives
""
 banks must take sensitivities and volatility of         underlying into account for determining  primary risk driver
    52
28 bank supervisors may also require more complex trades to be allocated to more        than one asset class
 resulting in  same position being included in multiple        classes
 in this case
 for each asset class to which  position is allocated
 banks        must determine appropriately  sign and delta adjustment of  relevant risk        driver 
 role of delta adjustments in sa-ccr is outlined furr in cre52

30 although  formulas for  asset class add-ons vary between asset classes
        y all use  following general steps
               
1
 the effective notional 
d
 must be calculated for each derivative 
ie each           individual trade
 in  netting set
 the effective notional is a measure of            sensitivity of  trade to movements in underlying risk factors 
ie interest           rates
 exchange rates
 credit spreads
 equity prices and commodity prices
""
           the effective notional is calculated as  product of  following           parameters 
ie d = d 
 mf 
 
""
             
a
 the adjusted notional 
d
""
 the adjusted notional is a measure of                size of  trade
 for derivatives in  foreign exchange asset class this               is simply  notional value of  foreign currency leg of  derivative               contract
 converted to  domestic currency
 for derivatives in                equity and commodity asset classes
" it is simply  current price of                relevant share or unit of commodity multiplied by  number of shares               /units   derivative references"
 for derivatives in  interest rate               and credit asset classes
  notional amount is adjusted by a measure               of  duration of  instrument to account for  fact   value               of instruments with longer durations are more sensitive to movements               in underlying risk factors 
ie interest rates and credit spreads
""
             
b
 the maturity factor 
mf
""
 the maturity factor is a parameter  takes               account of  time period over which  potential future exposure is               calculated
 the calculation of  maturity factor varies depending on               wher  netting set is margined or unmargined
             
c
   the supervisory delta 
""
""
 the supervisory delta is used to ensure                   effective notional take into account  direction of  trade
 ie                 wher  trade is long or short
 by having a positive or negative sign
                 it is also takes into account wher  trade has a non-linear                 relationship with  underlying risk factor 
which is  case for options                 and collateralised debt obligation tranches
""
         
2
 a supervisory factor 
sf
 is identified for each individual trade in            netting set
 the supervisory factor is  supervisory specified change in           value of  underlying risk factor on which  potential future exposure           calculation is based
 which has been calibrated to take into account            volatility of underlying risk factors
         
3
 the trades within each asset class are separated into supervisory specified           hedging sets
 the purpose of  hedging sets is to group toger trades           within  netting set where long and short positions should be permitted to           offset each or in  calculation of potential future exposure
            
4
 aggregation formulas are applied to aggregate  effective notionals and            supervisory factors across all trades within each hedging set and finally at             asset-class level to give  asset class level add-on
 the method of               aggregation varies between asset classes and for credit
 equity and             commodity derivatives it also involves  application of supervisory             correlation parameters to capture diversification of trades and basis risk

  remaining maturity                 equals  time until  next reset date
 this means  exchanges                 where daily settlement occurs are different from exchanges where daily                 margining occurs

47?                      for equity and commodity volatility transactions
  underlying                    volatility or variance referenced by  transaction should replace                     unit price and contractual notional should replace  number of units
      52
37 in many cases  trade notional amount is stated clearly and fixed until maturity
        when this is not  case
 banks must use  following rules to determine         trade notional amount
           
1
 where  notional is a formula of market values
  bank must enter              current market values to determine  trade notional amount
           
2

 where all rates in a swap are multiplied by a factor
              stated notional must be multiplied by  factor on  interest rates to             determine  trade notional amount
           
4
 for a derivative contract with multiple exchanges of principal
  notional is             multiplied by  number of exchanges of principal in  derivative contract             to determine  trade notional amount
           
5
 for a derivative contract  is structured such  on specified dates any             outstanding exposure is settled and  terms are reset so   fair value             of  contract is zero

 to convert         effective notional amounts into  add-on for each hedging set
 the way in         which supervisory factors are used within  aggregation formulas varies         between asset classes
 the supervisory factors are listed in table 2 under cre52
72       each factor has been calibrated to result in an add-on  reflects                      effective epe of a single at--money linear trade of unit notional and                     one-year maturity

        hedging sets  52
45 the hedging sets in  different asset classes are defined as follows
 except for        those described in cre52
46 and cre52
47
           
1
 interest rate derivatives consist of a separate hedging set for each currency
           
2
 fx derivatives consist of a separate hedging set for each currency pair
           
3
 credit derivatives consist of a single hedging set
           
4
 equity derivatives consist of a single hedging set
           
5
 commodity derivatives consist of four hedging sets defined for broad             categories of commodity derivatives
 energy

 agricultural and or             commodities
    52
46 derivatives  reference  basis between two risk factors and are        denominated in a single currency 
basis transactions
 must be treated within        separate hedging sets within  corresponding asset class
 there is a separate        hedging set for each pair of risk factors 
ie for each specific basis
""
 examples of        specific bases include three-month libor versus six-month libor
 three-month        libor versus three-month t-bill
 one-month libor versus overnight indexed swap        rate
 brent crude oil versus henry hub gas
 for hedging sets consisting of basis        transactions
  supervisory factor applicable to a given asset class must be        multiplied by one-half
     derivatives with two floating legs  are denominated in different                     currencies 
such as cross-currency swaps

volatility transactions
        must be treated within separate hedging sets within  corresponding asset        class
 volatility hedging sets must follow  same hedging set construction        outlined in cre52

for example
 all equity volatility transactions form a single        hedging set

      maturity factors  52
48 the minimum time risk horizon for an unmargined transaction is  lesser of one        year and  remaining maturity of  derivative contract
 floored at ten        business days
 therefore
  calculation of  effective notional for an        unmargined transaction includes  following maturity factor
 where mi is          remaining maturity of transaction i
 floored at 10 business days
       for example
 remaining maturity for a one-month option on a 10-year                     treasury bond is  one-month to expiration date of  derivative                     contract
 however
  end date of  transaction is  10-year                     remaining maturity on  treasury bond
      52
49 the maturity parameter 
mi
 is expressed in years but is subject to a floor of 10         business days
 banks should use standard market convention to convert business         days into years
 and vice versa
 for example
 250 business days in a year
" which         results in a floor of 10/250 years for mi"

 above
 is a single-factor        model

 the entity-level add-ons are        allowed to offset each or fully in  systematic component

 re is        no offsetting benefit in  idiosyncratic component
" these two components are        weighted by a correlation factor which determines  degree of offsetting        /hedging benefit within  credit derivatives asset class"
 the higher         correlation factor
  higher  importance of  systematic component
 hence         higher  degree of offsetting benefits
    52
63 it should be noted  a higher or lower correlation does not necessarily mean a        higher or lower capital requirement
 for portfolios consisting of long and short        credit positions
 a high correlation factor would reduce  charge
 for portfolios        consisting exclusively of long positions 
or short positions

 a higher correlation        factor would increase  charge
 if most of  risk consists of systematic risk
        n individual reference entities would be highly correlated and long and short        positions should offset each or

 however
 most of  risk is idiosyncratic to        a reference entity

      add-on for equity derivatives  52
65 the calculation of  add-on for  equity derivative asset class is very similar to         calculation of  add-on for  credit derivative asset class

 each separate equity index  is referenced by             derivatives in  equity derivative asset class should be treated as a separate             entity
 the combined effective notional of  entity

 in  formula  summations are across all entities             referenced by  derivatives
 addonentity is  add-on amount calculated              in step 3 for each entity referenced by  derivatives and entity is               supervisory prescribed correlation factor corresponding to  entity

67 the supervisory factors for equity derivatives were calibrated based on estimates        of  market volatility of equity indices
 with  application of a conservative        beta factor to translate this estimate into an estimate of individual volatilities
    the beta of an individual equity measures  volatility of  stock                     relative to a broad market index
 a value of beta greater than one                     means  individual equity is more volatile than  index
 the                     greater  beta is
  more volatile  stock
 the beta is calculated                     by running a linear regression of  stock on  broad index
      52
68 banks are not permitted to make any modelling assumptions in  calculation of         pfe add-ons
 including estimating individual volatilities or taking publicly        available estimates of beta
 this is a pragmatic approach to ensure a consistent        implementation across jurisdictions but also to keep  add-on calculation        relatively simple and prudent
 therefore
 bank must only use  two values of        supervisory factors  are defined for equity derivatives
 one for single entities        and one for indices
      add-on for commodity derivatives  52
69 the calculation of  add-on for  commodity derivative asset class is similar        to  calculation of  add-on for  credit and equity derivative asset classes
        it recognises  full offsetting of long and short positions for derivatives         reference  same type of underlying commodity
 it also allows partial offsetting        between derivatives  reference different types of commodity
 however
 this        partial offsetting is only permitted within each of  four hedging sets of         commodity derivative asset class
 where  different commodity types are more        likely to demonstrate some stable
 meaningful joint dynamics
 offsetting between        hedging sets is not recognised 
eg a forward contract on crude oil cannot hedge        a forward contract on corn

71 regarding  calculation steps above
 defining individual commodity types is        operationally difficult
 in fact
 it is impossible to fully specify all relevant        distinctions between commodity types so  all basis risk is captured
 for        example crude oil could be a commodity type within  energy hedging set
 but        in certain cases this definition could omit a substantial basis risk between        different types of crude oil

        also
  four commodity type hedging sets have been defined without regard to        characteristics such as location and quality

  energy hedging set        contains commodity types such as crude oil
 electricity
 natural gas and coal
        national supervisors may require banks to use more refined definitions of        commodities when y are significantly exposed to  basis risk of different        products within those commodity types

 one for margined transactions and one for                 unmargined transactions
 a margined transaction should be                 understood as a derivative transaction covered by a margin agreement                 such   banks counterparty must post variation margin to                  bank
 all derivative transactions  are not margined in this sense                 should be treated as unmargined transactions
 this distinction of                 margined or unmargined for  purposes of sa-ccr is unrelated                 to initial margin requirements of  transaction
                   the sa-ccr standard implicitly assumes  following generic                 variation margin set-up

 a qualifying internal model for measuring         counterparty credit exposure must specify  forecasting distribution for         changes in  market value of  netting set attributable to changes in market         variables

9   under  internal models method
  bank need not employ a single model
         although  following text describes an internal model as a simulation model
         no particular form of model is required
 analytical models are acceptable so long         as y are subject to supervisory review
 meet all of  requirements set forth in         this section and are applied to all material exposures subject to a ccr-related         capital requirement as noted above
 with  exception of long settlement         transactions
 which are treated separately
 and with  exception of those         exposures  are immaterial in size and risk
      53
10            expected exposure or peak exposure measures should be calculated based on a          distribution of exposures  accounts for  possible non-normality of           distribution of exposures
 including  existence of leptokurtosis 
fat tails

          where appropriate

11 when using an internal model
 exposure amount or ead is calculated as         product of alpha times effective epe

12 effective epe is computed by estimating expected exposure 
eet
 as  average          exposure at future date t
 where  average is taken across possible future          values of relevant market risk factors
 such as interest rates
 foreign exchange          rates

 t2
 t3          specifically
 effective ee is computed recursively using  following formula
          where  current date is denoted as t0 and effective eet0 equals current exposure
        in ory
  expectations should be taken with respect to  actual                      probability distribution of future exposure and not  risk-neutral one
                      supervisors recognise  practical considerations may make it more                      feasible to use  risk-neutral one
 as a result
 supervisors will not                      mandate which kind of forecasting distribution to employ
      53
13 in this regard
 effective epe is  average effective ee during  first year of        future exposure
 if all contracts in  netting set mature before one year
 epe is         average of expected exposure until all contracts in  netting set mature
        effective epe is computed as a weighted average of effective ee
 using         following formula where  weights tk = tk  tk-1 allows for  case when          future exposure is calculated at dates  are not equally spaced over time

15 supervisors have  discretion to require a higher alpha based on a banks ccr        exposures
 factors  may require a higher alpha include  low granularity of        counterparties
 particularly high exposures to general wrong-way risk
 particularly        high correlation of market values across counterparties

numerator
        and economic capital based on epe 
denominator
""
 assuming y meet certain        operating requirements
 eligible banks must meet all  operating requirements        for internal estimates of epe and must demonstrate  ir internal estimates        of alpha capture in  numerator  material sources of stochastic dependency        of distributions of market values of transactions or of portfolios of transactions        across counterparties 
eg  correlation of defaults across counterparties and        between market risk and default
""
    53
17 in  denominator
 epe must be used as if it were a fixed outstanding loan        amount
    53
18 to this end
 banks must ensure   numerator and denominator of alpha are        computed in a consistent fashion with respect to  modelling methodology
        parameter specifications and portfolio composition
 the approach used must be        based on  banks internal economic capital approach
 be well-documented        and be subject to independent validation
 in addition
 banks must review ir        estimates on at least a quarterly basis
 and more frequently when         composition of  portfolio varies over time
 banks must assess  model risk        and supervisors should be alert to  significant variation in estimates of alpha         arises from  possibility for mis-specification in  models used for         numerator
 especially where convexity is present
    53
19 where appropriate
 volatilities and correlations of market risk factors used in         joint simulation of market and credit risk should be conditioned on  credit risk        factor to reflect potential increases in volatility or correlation in an economic        downturn
 internal estimates of alpha should take account of  granularity of        exposures
        maturity  53
20 if  original maturity of  longest-dated contract contained in  set is        greater than one year
  formula for effective maturity 
m
 in cre32
42 is        replaced with formula  follows
 where dfk is  risk-free discount factor for         future time period tk and  remaining symbols are defined above
 similar to          treatment under corporate exposures
 m has a cap of five years
      conceptually
 m equals  effective credit duration of  counterparty                     exposure
 a bank  uses an internal model to calculate a one-sided                     credit valuation adjustment

21 for netting sets in which all contracts have an original maturity of less than one        year
  formula for effective maturity 
m

23 an epe model must also include transaction-specific information in order to        capture  effects of margining
 it must take into account both  current        amount of margin and margin  would be passed between counterparties in         future

 above
 only those banks in full compliance with  qualitative criteria will        be eligible for application of  minimum multiplication factor
 the qualitative        criteria include

 as well as comparing hypotical changes based on static           positions with realised measures
 risk measures in this context
 refers not           only to effective epe
  risk measure used to derive regulatory capital
 but           also to  or risk measures used in  calculation of effective epe such           as  exposure distribution at a series of future dates

  market risk factors used to derive           those exposures and  values of  constituent trades of a portfolio
         
2
 the bank must carry out an initial validation and an on-going periodic review           of its imm model and  risk measures generated by it
 the validation and           review must be independent of  model developers

4
 the banks internal risk measurement exposure model must be closely           integrated into  day-to-day risk management process of  bank
 its           output should accordingly be an integral part of  process of planning
           monitoring and controlling  banks counterparty credit risk profile
         
5
 the risk measurement system should be used in conjunction with internal           trading and exposure limits

 controls and procedures concerning            operation of  risk measurement system
 the banks risk measurement           system must be well documented
 for example
 through a risk management           manual  describes  basic principles of  risk management system           and  provides an explanation of  empirical techniques used to           measure counterparty credit risk
           
7
 an independent review of  risk measurement system should be carried           out regularly in  banks own internal auditing process
 this review should           include both  activities of  business trading units and of            independent risk control unit
 a review of  overall risk management           process should take place at regular intervals

 the on-going validation of counterparty credit risk models
 including           backtesting
 must be reviewed periodically by a level of management with           sufficient authority to decide  course of action  will be taken to           address weaknesses in  models
        53
29            banks must document  process for initial and on-going validation of ir          imm model to a level of detail  would enable a third party to recreate           analysis
 banks must also document  calculation of  risk measures          generated by  models to a level of detail  would allow a third party to re
         create  risk measures
 this documentation must set out  frequency with          which backtesting analysis and any or on-going validation will be conducted
          how  validation is conducted with respect to dataflows and portfolios and           analyses  are used
    53
30 banks must define criteria with which to assess ir epe models and  models         input into  calculation of epe and have a written policy in place         describes  process by which unacceptable performance will be determined        and remedied
    53
31 banks must define how representative counterparty portfolios are constructed for         purposes of validating an epe model and its risk measures
    53
32 when validating epe models and its risk measures  produce forecast        distributions
 validation must assess more than a single statistic of  model        distribution
    53
33 as part of  initial and on-going validation of an imm model and its risk        measures
  following requirements must be met
            
1
 a bank must carry out backtesting using historical data on movements in              market risk factors prior to supervisory approval
 backtesting must consider a              number of distinct prediction time horizons out to at least one year
 over a              range of various start 
initialisation
 dates and covering a wide range of              market conditions
            
2
 banks must backtest  performance of ir epe model and  models              relevant risk measures as well as  market risk factor predictions               support epe
 for collateralised trades
"  prediction time horizons              considered must include those reflecting typical margin periods of risk              applied in collateralised/margined trading"
 and must include long time              horizons of at least 1 year
            
3
 the pricing models used to calculate counterparty credit risk exposure for a              given scenario of future shocks to market risk factors must be tested as part              of  initial and on-going model validation process
 these pricing models              may be different from those used to calculate market risk over a short              horizon
 pricing models for options must account for  nonlinearity of              option value with respect to market risk factors
           
4
 an epe model must capture transaction specific information in order to           aggregate exposures at  level of  netting set
 banks must verify            transactions are assigned to  appropriate netting set within  model
         
5
 static
 historical backtesting on representative counterparty portfolios must           be a part of  validation process
 at regular intervals as directed by its           supervisor
 a bank must conduct such backtesting on a number of           representative counterparty portfolios
 the representative portfolios must be           chosen based on ir sensitivity to  material risk factors and correlations           to which  bank is exposed
 in addition
 imm banks need to conduct           backtesting  is designed to test  key assumptions of  epe model           and  relevant risk measures
 eg  modelled relationship between tenors           of  same risk factor
 and  modelled relationships between risk factors
         
6
 significant differences between realised exposures and  forecast           distribution could indicate a problem with  model or  underlying data             supervisor would require  bank to correct
 under such           circumstances
 supervisors may require additional capital to be held while            problem is being solved
         
7
 the performance of epe models and its risk measures must be subject to           good backtesting practice
 the backtesting programme must be capable of           identifying poor performance in an epe models risk measures
         
8
 banks must validate ir epe models and all relevant risk measures out to           time horizons commensurate with  maturity of trades for which exposure           is calculated using an internal models method
         
9
 the pricing models used to calculate counterparty exposure must be           regularly tested against appropriate independent benchmarks as part of            on-going model validation process
         
10
 the on-going validation of a banks epe model and  relevant risk            measures include an assessment of recent performance
         
11
 the frequency with which  parameters of an epe model are updated            needs to be assessed as part of  validation process
         
12
 under  imm
 a measure  is more conservative than  metric used            to calculate regulatory ead for every counterparty
 may be used in place of            alpha times effective epe with  prior approval of  supervisor
 the            degree of relative conservatism will be assessed upon initial supervisory            approval and at  regular supervisory reviews of  epe models
 the            bank must validate  conservatism regularly
                 
13
 the on-going assessment of model performance needs to cover all              counterparties for which  models are used
           
14
 the validation of imm models must assess wher or not  bank level              and netting set exposure calculations of epe are appropriate
      operational requirements for epe models  53
34 in order to be eligible to adopt an internal model for estimating epe arising from        ccr for regulatory capital purposes
 a bank must meet  following operational        requirements
 these include meeting  requirements related to  qualifying        standards on ccr management
 a use test
 stress testing
 identification of wrong
       way risk
 and internal controls
      qualifying standards on ccr management  53
35 the bank must satisfy its supervisor 
 in addition to meeting  operational        requirements identified in cre53
36 to cre53
60 below
 it adheres to sound        practices for ccr management
 including those specified in srp32
14 to srp32
27
      use test  53
36 the distribution of exposures generated by  internal model used to calculate        effective epe must be closely integrated into  day-to-day ccr management        process of  bank
 for example
  bank could use  peak exposure from         distributions for counterparty credit limits or expected positive exposure for its        internal allocation of capital
 the internal models output must accordingly play        an essential role in  credit approval
 counterparty credit risk management
        internal capital allocations
 and corporate governance of banks  seek        approval to apply such models for capital adequacy purposes
 models and        estimates designed and implemented exclusively to qualify for  internal        models method are not acceptable
    53
37 a bank must have a credible track record in  use of internal models         generate a distribution of exposures to ccr
 thus
  bank must demonstrate         it has been using an internal model to calculate  distributions of        exposures upon which  epe calculation is based  meets broadly         minimum requirements for at least one year prior to supervisory approval
      53
38 banks employing  internal models method must have an independent control        unit  is responsible for  design and implementation of  banks ccr        management system
 including  initial and on-going validation of  internal        model
 this unit must control input data integrity and produce and analyse daily        reports on  output of  banks risk measurement model
 including an        evaluation of  relationship between measures of ccr risk exposure and credit        and trading limits
 this unit must be independent from business credit and        trading units
 it must be adequately staffed
 it must report directly to senior        management of  bank
 the work of this unit should be closely integrated into         day-to-day credit risk management process of  bank
 its output should        accordingly be an integral part of  process of planning
 monitoring and        controlling  banks credit and overall risk profile
    53
39 banks applying  internal models method must have a collateral management        unit  is responsible for calculating and making margin calls
 managing margin        call disputes and reporting levels of independent amounts
 initial margins and        variation margins accurately on a daily basis
 this unit must control  integrity        of  data used to make margin calls
 and ensure  it is consistent and        reconciled regularly with all relevant sources of data within  bank
 this unit        must also track  extent of reuse of collateral 
both cash and non-cash
 and         rights   bank gives away to its respective counterparties for  collateral         it posts
 these internal reports must indicate  categories of collateral        assets  are reused
 and  terms of such reuse including instrument
 credit        quality and maturity
 the unit must also track concentration to individual        collateral asset classes accepted by  banks
 senior management must allocate        sufficient resources to this unit for its systems to have an appropriate level of        operational performance
 as measured by  timeliness and accuracy of        outgoing calls and response time to incoming calls
 senior management must        ensure  this unit is adequately staffed to process calls and disputes in a timely        manner even under severe market crisis
 and to enable  bank to limit its        number of large disputes caused by trade volumes
    53
40 the banks collateral management unit must produce and maintain appropriate        collateral management information  is reported on a regular basis to senior        management
 such internal reporting should include information on  type of        collateral 
both cash and non-cash
 received and posted
 as well as  size
 aging        and cause for margin call disputes
 this internal reporting should also reflect        trends in se figures
        53
41 a bank employing  internal models method must ensure  its cash        management policies account simultaneously for  liquidity risks of potential        incoming margin calls in  context of exchanges of variation margin or or        margin types
 such as initial or independent margin
 under adverse market        shocks
 potential incoming calls for  return of excess collateral posted by        counterparties
 and calls resulting from a potential downgrade of its own public         rating
 the bank must ensure   nature and horizon of collateral reuse is         consistent with its liquidity needs and does not jeopardise its ability to post or         return collateral in a timely manner
    53
42 the internal model used to generate  distribution of exposures must be part        of a counterparty risk management framework  includes  identification
        measurement
 management
 approval and internal reporting of counterparty risk
        this framework must include  measurement of usage of credit lines        
aggregating counterparty exposures with or credit exposures
 and economic        capital allocation
 in addition to epe 
a measure of future exposure
""
 a bank must        measure and manage current exposures
 where appropriate
  bank must        measure current exposure gross and net of collateral held
 the use test is satisfied        if a bank uses or counterparty risk measures
 such as peak exposure or        potential future exposure

43 a bank is not required to estimate or report ee daily
 but to meet  use test it        must have  systems capability to estimate ee daily
 if necessary
 unless it        demonstrates to its supervisor  its exposures to ccr warrant some less        frequent calculation
 it must choose a time profile of forecasting horizons         adequately reflects  time structure of future cash flows and maturity of         contracts
 for example
 a bank may compute ee on a daily basis for  first ten        days
 once a week out to one month
 once a month out to eighteen months
 once        a quarter out to five years and beyond five years in a manner  is consistent        with  materiality and composition of  exposure
    53
44 exposure must be measured out to  life of all contracts in  netting set 
not        just to  one year horizon
""
 monitored and controlled
 the bank must have        procedures in place to identify and control  risks for counterparties where        exposure rises beyond  one-year horizon
 moreover
  forecasted increase in        exposure must be an input into  banks internal economic capital model
        stress testing  53
45 a bank must have in place sound stress testing processes for use in         assessment of capital adequacy
 these stress measures must be compared        against  measure of epe and considered by  bank as part of its internal        capital adequacy assessment process
 stress testing must also involve identifying        possible events or future changes in economic conditions  could have        unfavourable effects on a banks credit exposures and assessment of  banks        ability to withstand such changes
 examples of scenarios  could be used are
        
i
 economic or industry downturns
 
ii
 market-place events
 or 
iii
 decreased        liquidity conditions
    53
46 banks must have a comprehensive stress testing program for counterparty credit        risk
 the stress testing program must include  following elements
           
1
 banks must ensure complete trade capture and exposure aggregation across             all forms of counterparty credit risk 
not just otc derivatives
 at              counterparty-specific level in a sufficient time frame to conduct regular             stress testing
           
2
 for all counterparties
 banks should produce
 at least monthly
 exposure             stress testing of principal market risk factors 
eg interest rates
 fx
 equities
             credit spreads
 and commodity prices
 in order to proactively identify
 and             when necessary
 reduce outsized concentrations to specific directional             sensitivities
           
3
 banks should apply multifactor stress testing scenarios and assess material             non-directional risks 
ie yield curve exposure
 basis risks
 etc
 at least             quarterly
 multiple-factor stress tests should
 at a minimum
 aim to address             scenarios in which a
 severe economic or market events have occurred
 b
             broad market liquidity has decreased significantly
 and c
  market impact             of liquidating positions of a large financial intermediary
 these stress tests             may be part of bank-wide stress testing
           
4
 stressed market movements have an impact not only on counterparty             exposures
 but also on  credit quality of counterparties
 at least quarterly
             banks should conduct stress testing applying stressed conditions to  joint             movement of exposures and counterparty creditworthiness
           
5
 exposure stress testing 
including single factor
 multifactor and material non
            directional risks
 and joint stressing of exposure and creditworthiness should             be performed at  counterparty-specific
 counterparty group 
eg industry             and region
""
 and aggregate bank-wide ccr levels
               
6
 stress tests results should be integrated into regular reporting to senior             management
 the analysis should capture  largest counterparty-level             impacts across  portfolio
 material concentrations within segments of              portfolio 
within  same industry or region
""
 and relevant portfolio and             counterparty specific trends
           
7
 the severity of factor shocks should be consistent with  purpose of              stress test
 when evaluating solvency under stress
" factor shocks should be             severe enough to capture historical extreme market environments and/or             extreme but plausible stressed market conditions"
 the impact of such shocks             on capital resources should be evaluated
 as well as  impact on capital             requirements and earnings
 for  purpose of day-to-day portfolio             monitoring
 hedging
 and management of concentrations
 banks should also             consider scenarios of lesser severity and higher probability
           
8
 banks should consider reverse stress tests to identify extreme
 but plausible
             scenarios  could result in significant adverse outcomes
           
9
 senior management must take a lead role in  integration of stress testing             into  risk management framework and risk culture of  bank and ensure               results are meaningful and proactively used to manage counterparty             credit risk
 at a minimum
  results of stress testing for significant             exposures should be compared to guidelines  express  banks risk             appetite and elevated for discussion and action when excessive or             concentrated risks are present
      wrong-way risk  53
47 banks must identify exposures  give rise to a greater degree of general        wrong-way risk
 stress testing and scenario analyses must be designed to identify        risk factors  are positively correlated with counterparty credit worthiness
        such testing needs to address  possibility of severe shocks occurring when        relationships between risk factors have changed
 banks should monitor general        wrong way risk by product
 by region
 by industry
 or by or categories  are        germane to  business
 reports should be provided to senior management and         appropriate committee of  board on a regular basis  communicate        wrong way risks and  steps  are being taken to manage  risk
        53
48 a bank is exposed to specific wrong-way risk if future exposure to a specific        counterparty is highly correlated with  counterpartys probability of default
        for example
 a company writing put options on its own stock creates wrong-way        exposures for  buyer  is specific to  counterparty
 a bank must have        procedures in place to identify
 monitor and control cases of specific wrong way           risk
 beginning at  inception of a trade and continuing through  life of          trade
 to calculate  ccr capital requirement
  instruments for which re         exists a legal connection between  counterparty and  underlying issuer
 and         for which specific wrong way risk has been identified
 are not considered to be in          same netting set as or transactions with  counterparty
 furrmore
 for         single-name credit default swaps where re exists a legal connection between          counterparty and  underlying issuer
 and where specific wrong way risk         has been identified
 ead in respect of such swap counterparty exposure equals          full expected loss in  remaining fair value of  underlying instruments         assuming  underlying issuer is in liquidation
 the use of  full expected loss         in remaining fair value of  underlying instrument allows  bank to recognise
         in respect of such swap
  market value  has been lost already and any         expected recoveries
 accordingly lgd for advanced or foundation irb banks must         be set to 100% for such swap transactions
 for banks using  standardised         approach
  risk weight to use is  of an unsecured transaction
 for equity         derivatives
 bond options
 securities financing transactions etc referencing a         single company where re exists a legal connection between  counterparty         and  underlying company
 and where specific wrong way risk has been         identified
 ead equals  value of  transaction under  assumption of a         jump-to-default of  underlying security
 inasmuch this makes re-use of         possibly existing 
market risk
 calculations 
for incremental risk charge
          already contain an lgd assumption
  lgd must be set to 100%
       note   recoveries may also be possible on  underlying                     instrument beneath such swap
 the capital requirements for such                     underlying exposure are to be calculated without reduction for                      swap which introduces wrong way risk
 generally this means  such                     underlying exposure will receive  risk weight and capital treatment                     associated with an unsecured transaction 
ie assuming such underlying                     exposure is an unsecured credit exposure

 with specific wrong-way risk
 can you provide an                    example?                      assume you hold a single name cds with no wrong-way risk
 then

 whilst  lgd assigned to  counterparty would                    be  of  corresponding netting set of  counterparty from                    whom  cds was bought
 now assume  this single name cds                    has specific wrong-way risk
 first
  cds is taken out of its netting                    set
 second
  ead should be equal to  expected loss on                     underlying reference asset
 conditional on default of  issuer of                     underlying
 ie assuming   reference asset has a pd of 100%
 if a                    non-zero recovery is assumed for  underlying asset
 n  lgd                    for  netting set assigned to  single name cds exposure in                     risk-weighted asset calculation is set to 100%
        integrity of modelling process  53
49 or operational requirements focus on  internal controls needed to ensure         integrity of model inputs
 specifically
  requirements address         transaction data
 historical market data
 frequency of calculation
 and valuation        models used in measuring epe
    53
50 the internal model must reflect transaction terms and specifications in a timely
        complete
 and conservative fashion
 such terms include
 but are not limited to
        contract notional amounts
 maturity
 reference assets
 collateral thresholds
        margining arrangements
 netting arrangements
 etc
 the terms and specifications        must reside in a secure database  is subject to formal and periodic audit
 the        process for recognising netting arrangements must require signoff by legal staff        to verify  legal enforceability of netting and be input into  database by an        independent unit
 the transmission of transaction terms and specifications data        to  internal model must also be subject to internal audit and formal        reconciliation processes must be in place between  internal model and source        data systems to verify on an ongoing basis  transaction terms and        specifications are being reflected in epe correctly or at least conservatively
        53
51 when  effective epe model is calibrated using historic market data
  bank        must employ current market data to compute current exposures and at least        three years of historical data must be used to estimate parameters of  model
        alternatively
 market implied data may be used to estimate parameters of         model
 in all cases
  data must be updated quarterly or more frequently if          market conditions warrant
 to calculate  effective epe using a stress        calibration
  bank must also calibrate effective epe using three years of data         include a period of stress to  credit default spreads of a banks        counterparties or calibrate effective epe using market implied data from a        suitable period of stress
 the following process will be used to assess         adequacy of  stress calibration
          
1
 the bank must demonstrate
 at least quarterly
   stress period            coincides with a period of increased cds or or credit spreads  such as            loan or corporate bond spreads  for a representative selection of  banks            counterparties with traded credit spreads

 current positions at            current market prices
 stressed volatilities
 stressed correlations and or            relevant stressed exposure model inputs from  3-year stress period and            
b
 current positions at end of stress period market prices
 stressed            volatilities
 stressed correlations and or relevant stressed exposure model            inputs from  3-year stress period
 supervisors may adjust  stress            calibration if  exposures of se benchmark portfolios deviate            substantially

 but can instead rely                     respectively on market implied and stressed market implied                     calibrations?                       this will depend on  specifics of  modelling framework
 but                     current exposure should be based on current market valuations
                     however
 in any case
 current exposure has to be based on current                     market data
 be y directly observed or implied by or observable                     prices which also need to be as of  valuation date
           faq2        can  basel committee confirm   stressed three year data                     period will be centred on  credit spread stress point
 ie re will be                     equal history used before and after  point? where  stress period                     occurs in  current three year data set
 is it correct  a separate                     stress data set would only be required once  stress point is more                     than 18 months in  past
 ie before   stress and current period                     will be  same?                       there is no explicit requirement   three-year data period needs                     to be centred on  credit spread stress period

52 for a bank to recognise in its ead calculations for otc derivatives  effect of        collateral or than cash of  same currency as  exposure itself

    53
54 the epe model 
and modifications made to it
 must be subject to an internal        model validation process
 the process must be clearly articulated in banks        policies and procedures
 the validation process must specify  kind of testing        needed to ensure model integrity and identify conditions under which        assumptions are violated and may result in an understatement of epe
 the        validation process must include a review of  comprehensiveness of  epe        model
 for example such as wher  epe model covers all products  have        a material contribution to counterparty risk exposures
    53
55 the use of an internal model to estimate epe
 and hence  exposure amount or        ead
 of positions subject to a ccr capital requirement will be conditional upon         explicit approval of  banks supervisory authority

56 in  basel framework and in prior documents
  committee has issued        guidance regarding  use of internal models to estimate certain parameters of        risk and determine minimum capital requirements against those risks

 for example
  integrity of  risk        management system
  skills of staff  will rely on such measures in        operational areas and in control functions
  accuracy of models
 and  rigour        of internal controls over relevant internal processes
 as an example

eg equities and bonds
 and products or types of business        which give rise to counterparty credit risk ie otc derivatives

 where  default fund contributions        from clearing members are segregated by product types and only accessible for        specific product types
  capital requirements for those default fund exposures        determined according to  formulae and methodology set forth below must be        calculated for each specific product giving rise to counterparty credit risk

 and 
iii

 in  case of one or more clearing member defaults
        the clearing member banks risk sensitive capital requirement for its default fund        contribution 
kcmi
 must be calculated using  formulae and methodology set          forth below
 this calculation may be performed by a ccp
 bank
 supervisor or          or body with access to  required data
 as long as  conditions in cre54

39 are met
      54
27 the clearing member banks risk sensitive capital requirement for its default fund        contribution 
kcmi
 is calculated in two steps
           
1
 calculate  hypotical capital requirement of  ccp due to its             counterparty credit risk exposures to all of its clearing members and ir             clients
           
2
 calculate  capital requirement for  clearing member bank
      hypotical capital requirement of  ccp    54
28 the first step in calculating  clearing member banks capital requirement for its        default fund contribution 
kcmi
 is to calculate  hypotical capital         requirement of  ccp 
kccp
 due to its counterparty credit risk exposures to all         of its clearing members and ir clients
 kccp is a hypotical capital         requirement for a ccp
 calculated on a consistent basis for  sole purpose of         determining  capitalisation of clearing member default fund contributions
 it         does not represent  actual capital requirements for a ccp which may be         determined by a ccp and its supervisor
    54
29 kccp is calculated using  following formula
 where
           
1
 rw is a risk weight of 20%           
2
 capital ratio is 8%           
3
 cm is  clearing member           
4
 eadi is  exposure amount of  ccp to clearing member i
 relating to              valuation at  end of  regulatory reporting date before  margin             called on  final margin call of  day is exchanged
 the exposure             includes both
               
a
  clearing members own transactions and client transactions                 guaranteed by  clearing member
 and

 the sum is over all clearing member accounts

 as with or parts of                      capital adequacy framework
  national supervisor of a bank                     may increase  risk weight
 an increase in such risk weight would be                     appropriate if
 for example
  clearing members in a ccp are not                     highly rated
 any such increase in risk weight is to be communicated                     by  affected banks to  person completing this calculation
      54
30 where clearing members provide client clearing services
 and client transactions        and collateral are held in separate 
individual or omnibus
 sub-accounts to         clearing members proprietary business
 each such client sub-account should        enter  sum in cre54
29 above separately
 ie  member ead in  formula        above is n  sum of  client sub-account eads and any house sub-account        ead
 this will ensure  client collateral cannot be used to offset  ccps        exposures to clearing members proprietary activity in  calculation of kccp
 if         any of se sub-accounts contains both derivatives and sfts
  ead of          sub-account is  sum of  derivative ead and  sft ead
    54
31 in  case  collateral is held against an account containing both sfts and        derivatives
  prefunded initial margin provided by  member or client must        be allocated to  sft and derivatives exposures in proportion to  respective        product specific eads

32 if  default fund contributions of  member 
dfi
 are not split with regard to         client and house sub-accounts
 y must be allocated per sub-account         according to  respective fraction  initial margin of  sub-account has in         relation to  total initial margin posted by or for  account of  clearing         member
    54

 eadi is calculated as  bilateral trade exposure  ccp has         against  clearing member using  sa-ccr

      the look-through approach  60
2   the lta requires a bank to risk weight  underlying exposures of a fund as if          exposures were held directly by  bank
 this is  most granular and risk
        sensitive approach
 it must be used when

 and           
2

    60
3   to satisfy condition 
1
 above
  frequency of financial reporting of  fund         must be  same as
 or more frequent than
  of  banks and          granularity of  financial information must be sufficient to calculate          corresponding risk weights

          60
4   under  lta banks must risk weight all underlying exposures of  fund as if         those exposures were directly held
 this includes
 for example
 any underlying         exposure arising from  funds derivatives activities for situations in which          underlying receives a risk weighting treatment under  calculation of minimum         risk-based capital requirements

 by 
ii

 and            multiplier used in  calculation of  potential future exposure will be           equal to 1
 whenever potential future exposure is unknown
 it will be           calculated as 15% of  sum of  notional values of  derivatives in            netting set
 the risk weight associated with  counterparty is applied to            counterparty credit risk exposure

    99
5   common waterfall for default and dilution losses
 in  first example
 it is         assumed  losses resulting from eir defaults or dilution within          securitised pool will be subject to a common waterfall

 when calculating  default risk of exposures                      with non-immaterial dilution risk ead will be calculated as                       outstanding amount minus  capital requirement for dilution prior to                      credit risk mitigation
          99
9   non-common waterfall for default and dilution losses
 in  second example
 it is         assumed   securitisation transaction does not have one common waterfall         for losses due to defaults and dilutions
 ie for  determination of  risk of a         specific tranche it is not only relevant what losses might be realised within          pool but also if those losses are resulting from default or a dilution event
    99
10 as  sec-irba assumes  re is one common waterfall
 it cannot be        applied without adjustments
 the following example illustrates one possible        scenario and a possible adjustment specific to this scenario
    99
11 while this example is meant as a guideline
 a bank should neverless consult        with its national supervisor as to how  capital calculation should be performed

 for  purpose of calculating a capital requirement         for tranche b
 can be limited to kirb
dilution
 however
 as  holder of tranche b         cannot be sure  tranche c will still be available to cover  first dilution         losses when y are realised  because  credit enhancement might already be         depleted due to earlier default losses  to ensure a prudent treatment
 it cannot         recognise  purchase discount as credit enhancement for dilution risk
 in          capital calculation
  bank providing tranche b should assume  50
000 of          securitised assets have already been defaulted and hence tranche c is no         longer available as credit enhancement and  exposure of  underlying assets         has been reduced to 950

senior note
 will take all default losses not covered by         purchase discount and all dilution losses not covered by  purchase        discount or  second-loss guarantee

dilution 
as in cre99

 but not to         recognise  second-loss guarantee as credit enhancement at all because it is         covering only dilution risk
    99
18 although this is a simple approach
 it is also fairly conservative
 therefore         following alternative for  senior tranche could be considered
           
1
 calculate  rwa amount for tranche a under  assumption  it is             only exposed to losses resulting from defaults
 this assumption implies              tranche a is benefiting from a credit enhancement of 50
000
           
2
 calculate  rwa amounts for tranche c and 
hypotical
 tranche a
             under  assumption  y are only exposed to dilution losses
 tranche             a
 should be assumed to absorb losses above 300
000 up to 1
000
000
             with respect to dilution losses
 this approach would recognise               senior tranche investor cannot be sure if  purchase price discount will still             be available to cover those losses when needed as it might have already             been used for defaults
 consequently
 from  perspective of  senior             investor
  purchase price discount could only be recognised for              calculation of  capital requirement for default or dilution risk but not for             both
                
3
 sum up  rwa amounts under cre99
18
1
 and cre99

2
 and apply             relevant risk weight floor in cre44
26 or cre44
29 to determine  final            rwa amount for  senior note investor
        in this example
  purchase price discount was recognised in                          default risk calculation
 but banks could also choose to use it for                          dilution risk calculation
 it is also assumed   second-loss dilution                         guarantee explicitly covers dilution losses above 50
000 up to                         300

 if  guarantee instead covered 250

105 the case of central clearing can be viewed from a number of perspectives
 one        example in which  replacement cost formula for margined trades can be        applied is when  bank is a clearing member and is calculating replacement        cost for its own trades with a central counterparty

 in its capacity as clearing member of a ccp
 has posted vm to  ccp        in an amount equal to  value of  trades it has with  ccp
 the bank has        posted cash as initial margin and  ccp holds  initial margin in a bankruptcy        remote fashion
 assume   value of trades with  ccp are negative 50        million
  bank has posted 50 million in vm and 10 million in initial margin        
im

        99
107 given   im is held by  ccp in a bankruptcy-remote fashion

                                              definition of market risk  10
1   market risk is defined as  risk of losses in on and off-balance-sheet positions         arising from movements in market prices
 the risks subject to this requirement         are
           
1
 the risks pertaining to interest rate related instruments and equities in              trading book
           
2
 foreign exchange risk and commodities risk throughout  bank
      scope and coverage of  capital requirements  10
2   the capital requirements for interest rate related instruments and equities will         apply to  current trading book items prudently valued by banks
 alongside         cap50
 the definition of trading book is set out in rbc25
    10
3   all transactions
 including forward sales and purchases
 shall be included in          calculation of capital requirements as from  date on which y were entered         into
 although regular reporting will in principle take place only at intervals 
in         most countries quarterly
""
 banks are expected to manage  market risk in ir         trading book in such a way   capital requirements are being met on a         continuous basis
 ie at  close of each business day
 supervisory authorities         have at ir disposal a number of effective measures to ensure  banks do not         window-dress by showing significantly lower market risk positions on reporting         dates
 banks will also
 of course
 be expected to maintain strict risk management         systems to ensure  intra-day exposures are not excessive
 if a bank fails to         meet  capital requirements
  national authority shall ensure   bank         takes immediate measures to rectify  situation
    10
4   the capital requirements for foreign exchange risk and for commodities risk will         apply to banks total currency and commodity positions
 subject to some         discretion to exclude structural foreign exchange positions
 it is understood          some of se positions will be reported and hence evaluated at market value
         but some may be reported and evaluated at book value
    10
5   a matched currency position will protect a bank against loss from movements in         exchange rates
 but will not necessarily protect its capital adequacy ratio
 if a         bank has its capital denominated in its domestic currency and has a portfolio of         foreign currency assets and liabilities  is completely matched
" its capital/asset         ratio will fall if  domestic currency depreciates"
 by running a short position in          domestic currency  bank can protect its capital adequacy ratio
 although          position would lead to a loss if  domestic currency were to appreciate
      10
6   supervisory authorities are free to allow banks to protect ir capital adequacy         ratio in this way
 thus
 any positions which a bank has deliberately taken in order         to hedge partially or totally against  adverse effect of  exchange rate on its         capital ratio may be excluded from  calculation of net open currency positions
         subject to each of  following conditions being met
           
1
 such positions need to be of a structural
 ie of a non-dealing
 nature 
             precise definition to be set by national authorities according to national             accounting standards and practices
""
           
2
  national authority needs to be satisfied   structural position             excluded does no more than protect  banks capital adequacy ratio
           
3
 any exclusion of  position needs to be applied consistently
 with              treatment of  hedge remaining  same for  life of  assets or or             items
    10
7   no capital requirements need apply to positions related to items  are         deducted from a banks capital when calculating its capital base
 such as         investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries
 nor to or long-term         participations denominated in foreign currencies which are reported in          published accounts at historic cost
 these may also be treated as structural         positions
    10
8   positions in  banks own eligible regulatory capital instruments are deducted         from capital
 positions in or banks
 securities firms
 and or financial         entities eligible regulatory capital instruments
 as well as intangible assets
 will         receive  same treatment as  set down by  national supervisor for such         assets held in  banking book
 which in many cases is deduction from capital
         where a bank demonstrates  it is an active market maker n a national         supervisor may establish a dealer exception for holdings of or banks
         securities firms
 and or financial entities capital instruments in  trading         book
 in order to qualify for  dealer exception
  bank must have adequate         systems and controls surrounding  trading of financial institutions eligible         regulatory capital instruments
          10
9   in  same way as for credit risk
  capital requirements for market risk are to         apply on a worldwide consolidated basis
 where appropriate
 national authorities         may permit banking and financial entities in a group which is running a global         consolidated book and whose capital is being assessed on a global basis to         report short and long positions in exactly  same instrument 
eg currencies
         commodities
 equities or bonds
""
 on a net basis
 no matter where y are booked
                    moreover
  offsetting rules as set out in this section may also be applied on a         consolidated basis
 noneless
 re will be circumstances in which supervisory         authorities demand   individual positions be taken into  measurement         system without any offsetting or netting against positions in  remainder of          group
 this may be needed
 for example
 where re are obstacles to  quick         repatriation of profits from a foreign subsidiary or where re are legal and         procedural difficulties in carrying out  timely management of risks on a         consolidated basis
 moreover
 all national authorities will retain  right to         continue to monitor  market risks of individual entities on a non-consolidated         basis to ensure  significant imbalances within a group do not escape         supervision
 supervisory authorities will be especially vigilant in ensuring          banks do not pass positions on reporting dates in such a way as to escape         measurement
         the positions of less than wholly-owned subsidiaries would be subject                     to  generally accepted accounting principles in  country where                      parent company is supervised

             faq       faq1      leveraged super-senior tranches have to be treated according to                 standardised rules
 we hedge leveraged super-senior tranches with                 non-leveraged super-senior tranches
 this has  bad effect of                 increasing  credit risk capital requirement because of unhedged                 positions and increasing  floor for  comprehensive risk measure                 at  same time for  same reason
 can we treat  super-senior                 tranches which serve as hedges to leveraged super-senior tranches in                  same way as leveraged super-senior tranches?                   from an economical point it makes sense to treat positions and ir                 hedges toger for capital calculations
 this may be acceptable as                 long as this is done in a consistent way and  supervisor can be                 reassured  no capital arbitrage is done by changing  scope of                 comprehensive risk measure modelling on an ongoing basis
                   from a regulatory perspective this exclusion may also be acceptable

 requirement and                  correlation trading portfolio?                   syntically leveraged super-senior tranche in this context refers                 specifically to a type of position  has a non-linear pay-off profile                 referencing a super-senior collateralised debt obligation 
cdo
                 position
 in any case
  non-linearity is driven by  fact                   super-senior tranche is leveraged
 beyond this
  non-linearity may                 also result from  presence of certain trigger events  can cause                  pay-off from a leveraged super-senior position to be dislocated                 from  of  super-senior tranche to which it is referenced under                         certain scenarios
 in this context
 a syntically leveraged super-senior                 position does not provide a pro-rata share in  proceeds of a                 securitisation tranche
                   the following example highlights  inconsistency between                  leveraged super-senior tranche and  super-senior tranche  leads                 to its exclusion
 this example is stylised and is based on a description                 of leveraged super-senior tranches provided in a deservigny and n                 jost

 standard and poors
                   consider a cdo with 100 obligors
 suppose   super-senior                 tranche is defined with an attachment point of 20% of pool losses and                 a detachment point of 100% of pool losses
 accordingly
 a protection                 seller of a super-senior tranche receives a pre-specified payment over                  life of  tranche
 say five years
 in return for protecting                  protection buyer against all losses in excess of 20% of  pools                 notional value
 say $100m
 now consider a leveraged super-senior                 tranche  is structured as follows
 the leveraged super-senior                 tranche is identified with an attachment point of 20% and a                 detachment point of 28%
 furr  leveraged super-senior tranche is                 subject to a trigger
 the trigger is a pre-specified event
 the                 occurrence of  trigger events results in an unwind
 in  event of                 an unwind  protection seller makes a cash payment to                  protection buyer sufficient to purchase protection on losses from 29%                 to 100% of  pool
 consider  case of a weighted average spread                 
was
 trigger in which case an unwind occurs if  was of all                 names in  cdo portfolio exceeds 200 basis points
                   now consider  following event
 on  first day of  transaction
                 all credit default swap spreads on all obligors increase from 100 to 250                 basis points and remain at  level until  end of year five
 at                  end of year five
 no defaults have occurred in  portfolio
                   in this case  protection seller of  super-senior tranche has                 received all premium payments and made no payments
 accordingly
                  protection seller books a net profit
 in  case of  leveraged                 super-senior tranche
  protection seller receives no premium                 payments and makes a payment on day one to purchase protection on                  28% to 100% portion of  super-senior tranche
 accordingly
                  protection seller has booked a net loss
                   this example illustrates   proceeds from an investment in a                 super-senior and a leveraged super-senior tranche are not always                 proportional
 two specific points are worth noting here
 first
                  proceeds of two investment structures are considered to be                      proportional 
pro rata
 if this is  case in all possible scenarios
                    proportionality makes no reference to  likelihood of any set of                    events
 second
 in  case of leveraged super-senior tranches  non
                   proportionality is driven by  presence of trigger events  result in                    a divergence between  payoff of  super-senior tranche and                     leveraged super-senior tranche
 the example above has considered one                    particular sort of trigger
 in general re are a variety of complex                    trigger events  are built into leveraged super-senior structures
                    whenever se triggers result in a divergence of  payoffs of                     leveraged super-senior tranche from  corresponding super-senior                    tranche  leveraged super-senior tranche would be excluded from                     correlation trading portfolio

                      the intent is to ensure   spe structure is not used to evade                     criteria limiting  types of positions  may be included in                     correlation trading portfolio

 a bank must exclude from                     correlation trading portfolio any spe-issued instrument backed
 directly                    or indirectly
 by a position  would itself be excluded if held by                     bank directly
 thus

 however
 a cash cdo position could be                    included in  correlation trading portfolio if  assets underlying                     cdo met all of  relevant criteria

        methods of measuring market risks  10
11 each bank subject to capital requirements for market risk will be expected to        monitor and report  level of risk against which a capital requirement is to be        applied
 in measuring ir market risks
 a choice between two broad        methodologies 
described in mar20 and mar30
 respectively
 will be permitted
        subject to  approval of  national authorities
           
1
 one alternative will be to measure  risks in a standardised manner
 using              measurement frameworks described in mar20
             
2
 the alternative methodology
 which is subject to  fulfilment of certain             conditions and  use of which is refore conditional upon  explicit             approval of  banks supervisory authority
 is set out in mar30
 this             method allows banks to use risk measures derived from ir own internal             risk management models
 subject to seven sets of general conditions

12 unless a banks exposure to a particular risk factor
 such as commodity prices
 is        insignificant
  internal models approach will in principle require banks to have        an integrated risk measurement system  captures  broad risk factor        categories 
ie interest rates
 exchange rates 
which may include gold
""
 equity        prices and commodity prices
 with related options volatilities being included in        each risk factor category
""
 thus
 banks which start to use models for one or more        risk factor categories will
 over time
 be expected to extend  models to all ir        market risks
 a bank which has developed one or more models will no longer be        able to revert to measuring  risk measured by those models according to         standardised methodology 
unless  supervisory authority withdraws approval        for  model
""
 however
 pending furr experience regarding  process of        changing to an internal models approach
 no specific time limit will be set for        banks which use a combination of internal models and  standardised        approach to move to a comprehensive model
 the following conditions will apply        to banks using such combinations
               
1
 each broad risk factor category must be assessed using a single approach           
eir internal models or  standardised approach
""
 ie no combination of                two methods will in principle be permitted within a risk category or           across banks different entities for  same type of risk 
but see mar10
12           above
""
         
2
 all  criteria laid down in mar30 will apply to  models being used
         
3
 banks may not modify  combination of  two approaches y use           without justifying to ir supervisory authority  y have a good reason           for doing so
         
4
 no element of market risk may escape measurement
 ie  exposure for all            various risk factors
 wher calculated according to  standardised           approach or internal models
 would have to be captured
         
5
 the capital requirements assessed under  standardised approach and           under  models approach are to be aggregated according to  simple           sum method
      however
 banks may incur risks in positions which are not captured by                   ir models
 for example
 in remote locations
 in minor currencies or                   in negligible business areas
 such risks should be measured according                   to  standardised methodology
                faq        faq1        will partial model approvals be allowed under  framework 
eg
                    internal models for some credit positions
 with standardised specific                    risk charges for positions not having approved incremental risk capital                    
irc
 or comprehensive risk models
?                      partial approval will be permitted on a case-by-case basis in line with                    local regulations
 in particular
 as new products and businesses arise                    supervisors may want to have  authority to restrict certain products                    from  irc or comprehensive risk model
 a simple model for partial                    approval would be
                      
one set of products are approved for irc
 for se products re is                      a single comprehensive
 fully integrated model
 not a set of irc                      models taken one at a time
 likewise
 a similar approach would be                      used for comprehensive risk models
                      
the remaining products attract  fallback capital requirement                      according to  standardised measurement method
                      to clarify
 this does not mean  a bank would be able to have                    partial use for any particular element of specific interest rate risk 
eg                    include corporate positions in var for specific risk without including                    corporates in  irc

        types of market risk capital requirement  10
13 the minimum capital requirement for market risk is expressed in terms of
          
1
 general market risk
 and          
2
 specific risk 
ie risk associated with exposures to specific issuers of debt            securities or equities
""
           specific risk includes  risk  an individual debt or equity security                     moves by more or less than  general market in day-to-day trading                     
including periods when  whole market is volatile
 and event risk                     
where  price of an individual debt or equity security moves                     precipitously relative to  general market
 eg on a take-over bid or                     some or shock event
 such events would also include  risk of                     default
""
        treatment of specific risk using  internal models approach  10
14 the standardised approach uses a building-block approach in which specific        risk and  general market risk arising from debt and equity positions are        calculated separately
 the focus of most internal models is a banks general        market risk exposure
 typically leaving specific risk to be measured largely        through separate credit risk measurement systems
 banks using models should        be subject to capital requirements for  specific risk not captured by ir        models
 accordingly
 a separate capital requirement for specific risk will apply to        each bank using a model to  extent   model does not capture specific        risk
 the capital requirement for banks which are modelling specific risk is set out        in mar10
15 to mar10

 where a bank has a value-at-risk

 measure         incorporates specific risk from equity risk positions and where a supervisor has        determined   bank meets all  qualitative and quantitative requirements        for general market risk models
 as well as  additional criteria and requirements        set out in paragraphs mar30

2
  use of an internal model will be conditional                   upon  explicit approval of  banks supervisors
 only when a bank                   holds  two supervisory approvals 
""
1
 approval to use  market                   risk model which extends to specific interest rate risk
 and 
2
 approval                   to use an irc requirement model
 can it avoid using  standardised                   approach for determining  minimum capital requirements for                   specific interest rate risk
 the supervisor may grant both approvals in a                          single administrative act
 as se approvals relate to different internal                    models
 however
 in practice  supervisor may perform  necessary                    assessments under distinct approval processes
                      wher banks need separate approval for each product for  irc                    requirement model 
and  market risk model for specific risk
""
 or                    wher  supervisor grants a blanket approval
 depends on                     implementation of  market risk framework in  relevant                    jurisdiction

17 for securitisation exposures and n-th-defualt credit derivatives
  bank is        allowed to include its securitisation exposures and n-th-to-default credit        derivatives in its var measure
 notwithstanding
 it is still required to hold        additional capital for se products according to  standardised approach
        with  exceptions noted in mar30
35 to mar30
43
             faq         faq1       according to mar10
17
 even a bank  includes securitisation                    exposures or n-th-to-default credit derivatives in its var measure must                    hold additional capital for se products according to  standardised                    measurement method
 with  exceptions noted in mar30
35 to                    mar30

 with respect to general market risk  bank may still be                    allowed to determine  capital requirement for those products using                    a var model according to mar30
15
 this leads to  question which                    risks are considered general market risk with respect to var modelling
                    the main issue in this context is wher credit spread risks form part                    of specific risk or general market risk
                      there is no unified approach across banks or across jurisdictions on                    how to make  distinction between general market risk and specific                    risks
 banks are invited to turn to ir national supervisor for guidance

 the instruments covered include all fixed-rate and floating-rate         debt securities and instruments  behave like m
 including non-convertible         preference shares
 convertible bonds
 ie debt issues or preference shares          are convertible

30 to mar20
39 below
        traded mortgage securities and mortgage derivative products possess                     unique characteristics because of  risk of prepayment
 accordingly
                     for  time being
 no common treatment will apply to se securities
                     which will be dealt with at national discretion
 a security which is                      subject of a repurchase or securities lending agreement will be treated                     as if it were still owned by  lender of  security
 ie it will be treated                     in  same manner as or securities positions
            20
3   the minimum capital requirement is expressed in terms of two separately         calculated amounts
 one applying to  specific risk of each security
 wher it         is a short or a long position
 and  or to  interest rate risk in  portfolio         
termed general market risk
 where long and short positions in different         securities or instruments can be offset
      specific risk    20
4   the capital requirement for specific risk is designed to protect against an adverse         movement in  price of an individual security owing to factors related to          individual issuer
 in measuring  risk
 offsetting will be restricted to matched         positions in  identical issue 
including positions in derivatives
""
 even if          issuer is  same
 no offsetting will be permitted between different issues since         differences in coupon rates

                      in addition
 partial offsetting is allowed in two or sets of                    circumstances
 one set of circumstances is described in mar20
20 and                    concerns n-th-to-default basked products
 the or set of                    circumstances described in mar20

17 pertains to                    offsetting between a credit derivative 
wher total return swap or                    credit default swap
 and  underlying exposure 
ie cash position

                    although this treatment applies generally in a one-for-one fashion
 it is                    possible  multiple instruments could combine to create a hedge                     would be eligible for consideration for partial offsetting

 it is worth noting                   conditions under which partial or full offsetting of risk positions                  are subject to interest rate specific risk are narrowly defined
 in                 practice
 offsets between securitisation positions and credit derivatives                 are unlikely to be recognised in most cases due to  explicit                 requirements in mar20

26 the next step in  calculation is to offset  weighted longs and shorts in each        time-band
 resulting in a single short or long position for each band
 since
        however
 each band would include different instruments and different maturities
        a 10% capital requirement to reflect basis risk and gap risk will be levied on         smaller of  offsetting positions
 be it long or short
 thus
 if  sum of         weighted longs in a time-band is $100 million and  sum of  weighted        shorts $90 million
  so-called vertical disallowance for  time-band would        be 10% of $90 million 
ie $9
0 million
""
      20
27 the result of  above calculations is to produce two sets of weighted positions
         net long or short positions in each time-band 
$10 million long in         example above
 and  vertical disallowances
 which have no sign
           
1
 in addition
 however
 banks will be allowed to conduct two rounds of             horizontal offsetting
               
a
 first between  net positions in each of three zones
 where zone 1 is                 set as zero to one year
 zone 2 is set as one year to four years
 and zone                 3 is set as four years and over 
however
 for coupons less than 3%
 zone                 2 is set as one year to 3
6 years and zone 3 is set as 3
6 years and over
""
                 and               
b
 subsequently between  net positions in  three different zones
             
2
 the offsetting will be subject to a scale of disallowances expressed as a           fraction of  matched positions
 as set out in table 3 below
 the weighted           long and short positions in each of three zones may be offset
 subject to            matched portion attracting a disallowance factor  is part of  capital           requirement
 the residual net position in each zone may be carried over and           offset against opposite positions in or zones
 subject to a second set of           disallowance factors

28 under  alternative duration method
 banks with  necessary capability may
        with ir supervisors consent
 use a more accurate method of measuring all of          ir general market risk by calculating  price sensitivity of each position        separately
 banks must elect and use  method on a continuous basis 
unless a        change in method is approved by  national authority
 and will be subject to        supervisory monitoring of  systems used
 the mechanics of this method are as        follows
          
1
 first calculate  price sensitivity of each instrument in terms of a change in            interest rates of between 0
6 and 1
0 percentage points depending on             maturity of  instrument 
see table 4 below
""
          
2
 slot  resulting sensitivity measures into a duration-based ladder with             fifteen time-bands set out in table 4
          
3
 subject long and short positions in each time-band to a 5% vertical            disallowance designed to capture basis risk
          
4
 carry forward  net positions in each time-band for horizontal offsetting            subject to  disallowances set out in table 3 of mar20

      interest rate derivatives    20
30 the measurement system should include all interest rate derivatives and off
       balance-sheet instruments in  trading book which react to changes in interest        rates
 
eg fras
 or forward contracts
 bond futures
 interest rate and cross
       currency swaps and forward foreign exchange positions
""
 options can be treated        in a variety of ways as described in mar20
73 to mar20
85 below
 a summary of         rules for dealing with interest rate derivatives is set out in mar20
39 below
    20
31 the derivatives should be converted into positions in  relevant underlying and        become subject to specific and general market risk charges as described above
        in order to calculate  standard formula described above
  amounts        reported should be  market value of  principal amount of  underlying or        of  notional underlying resulting from  prudent valuation guidance set out        in cap50
     for instruments where  apparent notional amount differs from                      effective notional amount
 banks must use  effective notional                     amount
      20
32 futures and forward contracts 
including fras
 are treated as a combination of a        long and a short position in a notional government security
 the maturity of a        future or a fra will be  period until delivery or exercise of  contract
 plus 
       where applicable 
 life of  underlying instrument
 for example
 a long        position in a june three-month interest-rate future 
taken in april
 is to be        reported as a long position in a government security with a maturity of five        months and a short position in a government security with a maturity of two        months
 where a range of deliverable instruments may be delivered to fulfil         contract
  bank has flexibility to elect which deliverable security goes into         maturity or duration ladder but should take account of any conversion factor        defined by  exchange
 in  case of a future on a corporate bond index
        positions will be included at  market value of  notional underlying portfolio        of securities
      20
33          swaps will be treated as two notional positions in government securities with          relevant maturities
 for example
 an interest rate swap under which a bank is          receiving floating-rate interest and paying fixed will be treated as a long position          in a floating-rate instrument of maturity equivalent to  period until  next          interest fixing and a short position in a fixed-rate instrument of maturity          equivalent to  residual life of  swap
 for swaps  pay or receive a fixed or          floating interest rate against some or reference price
 eg a stock index
           interest rate component should be slotted into  appropriate repricing maturity          category
 with  equity component being included in  equity framework
 the          separate legs of cross-currency swaps are to be reported in  relevant maturity          ladders for  currencies concerned
    20
34 banks may exclude from  interest rate maturity framework altoger 
for both        specific and general market risk
 long and short positions 
both actual and        notional
 in identical instruments with exactly  same issuer
 coupon
 currency        and maturity
 a matched position in a future or forward and its corresponding        underlying may also be fully offset
 and thus excluded from  calculation
        when  future or  forward comprises a range of deliverable instruments        offsetting of positions in  future or forward contract and its underlying is only        permissible in cases where re is a readily identifiable underlying security which        is most profitable for  trader with a short position to deliver
 the price of this        security
 sometimes called  cheapest-to-deliver
 and  price of  future        or forward contract should in such cases move in close alignment
 no offsetting        will be allowed between positions in different currencies
  separate legs of        cross-currency swaps or forward foreign exchange deals are to be treated as        notional positions in  relevant instruments and included in  appropriate        calculation for each currency
        the leg representing  time to expiry of  future should
 however
                      be reported
      20
35 in addition
 opposite positions in  same category of instruments can in        certain circumstances be regarded as matched and allowed to offset fully
 to        qualify for this treatment  positions must relate to  same underlying        instruments
 be of  same nominal value and be denominated in  same        currency
 in addition
            
1
 for futures
 offsetting positions in  notional or underlying instruments to              which  futures contract relates must be for identical products and mature              within seven days of each or
           
2
 for swaps and fras
  reference rate 
for floating rate positions
 must be             identical and  coupon closely matched 
ie within 15 basis points
""
 and           
3
 for swaps
 fras and forwards
  next interest fixing date or
 for fixed
            coupon positions or forwards
  residual maturity must correspond within              following limits
                
a
 less than one month hence
 same day
                
b
 between one month and one year hence
 within seven days
                
c
   over one year hence
 within thirty days
   this includes  delta-equivalent value of options
 the delta                      equivalent of  legs arising out of  treatment of caps and floors as                      set out in mar20
77 can also be offset against each or under                       rules laid down in this paragraph
      the separate legs of different swaps may also be matched subject to                       same conditions
      20
36 banks with large swap books may use alternative formulae for se swaps to        calculate  positions to be included in  maturity or duration ladder
 one        method would be to first convert  payments required by  swap into ir        present values
 for  purpose
 each payment should be discounted using zero        coupon yields
 and a single net figure for  present value of  cash flows        entered into  appropriate time-band using procedures  apply to zero
""
or        low-
 coupon bonds
 se figures should be slotted into  general market risk        framework as set out above
 an alternative method would be to calculate         sensitivity of  net present value implied by  change in yield used in         maturity or duration method and allocate se sensitivities into  time-bands        set out in mar20
25 or mar20
28
 or methods which produce similar results        could also be used
 such alternative treatments will
 however
 only be allowed if
           
1
  supervisory authority is fully satisfied with  accuracy of  systems             being used
           
2
  positions calculated fully reflect  sensitivity of  cash flows to             interest rate changes and are entered into  appropriate time-bands
 and           
3
  positions are denominated in  same currency
        20
37            interest rate and currency swaps
 fras
 forward foreign exchange contracts and          interest rate futures will not be subject to a specific risk charge
 this exemption          also applies to futures on an interest rate index 
eg  london interbank offered          rate
 or libor
""
 however
 in  case of futures contracts where  underlying is          a debt security
 or an index representing a basket of debt securities
 a specific risk          charge will apply according to  credit risk of  issuer as set out in mar20
4          to mar20
21 above
    20
38 general market risk applies to positions in all derivative products in  same        manner as for cash positions
 subject only to an exemption for fully or very        closely matched positions in identical instruments as defined in mar20
34 and        mar20
35
 the various categories of instruments should be slotted into         maturity ladder and treated according to  rules identified earlier

  minimum capital standard for equities is expressed in        terms of two separately calculated capital requirements for  specific risk of        holding a long or short position in an individual equity and for  general        market risk of holding a long or short position in  market as a whole
 specific        risk is defined as  banks gross equity positions 
ie  sum of all long equity        positions and of all short equity positions
 and general market risk as         difference between  sum of  longs and  sum of  shorts 
ie  overall        net position in an equity market

44 in order to calculate  standard formula for specific and general market risk
        positions in derivatives should be converted into notional equity positions
           
1
 futures and forward contracts relating to individual equities should in             principle be reported at current market prices
           
2
 futures relating to stock indices should be reported as  marked-to

 equity swaps are to be treated as two notional positions

46 besides general market risk
 a furr capital requirement of 2% will apply to         net long or short position in an index contract comprising a diversified portfolio        of equities
 this capital requirement is intended to cover factors such as        execution risk
 national supervisory authorities will take care to ensure  this        2% risk weight applies only to well-diversified indices and not
 for example
 to        sectoral indices

         additional 2% capital requirement described above 
set out in mar20

 may be        applied to only one index with  opposite position exempt from a capital        requirement

 and            
2
 when  bank has an opposite position in contracts at  same date in              different but similar indices
 subject to supervisory oversight   two              indices contain sufficient common components to justify offsetting
    20
48 where a bank engages in a deliberate arbitrage strategy
 in which a futures        contract on a broadly based index matches a basket of stocks
 it will be allowed        to carve out both positions from  standardised methodology on condition 
            
1
  trade has been deliberately entered into and separately controlled
 and

49 in such a case as set out in mar20
48  minimum capital requirement will be        4%

63 the price risk in commodities is often more complex and volatile than         associated with currencies and interest rates
 commodity markets may also be        less liquid than those for interest rates and currencies and
 as a result
 changes in        supply and demand can have a more dramatic effect on price and volatility
        these market characteristics can make price transparency and  effective        hedging of commodities risk more difficult
          banks need also to guard against  risk  arises when  short                      position falls due before  long position
 owing to a shortage of                      liquidity in some markets it might be difficult to close  short position                      and  bank might be squeezed by  market
      20
64 the risks associated with commodities include  following risks
           
1
 for spot or physical trading
  directional risk arising from a change in              spot price is  most important risk
           
2
 however
 banks using portfolio strategies involving forward and derivative             contracts are exposed to a variety of additional risks
 which may well be             larger than  risk of a change in spot prices
 these include
                
a
 basis risk 
 risk   relationship between  prices of similar                  commodities alters through time
""
                
b
 interest rate risk 
 risk of a change in  cost of carry for forward                  positions and options
""
 and                
c
   forward gap risk 
 risk   forward price may change for reasons                    or than a change in interest rates
""
           
3
 in addition banks may face counterparty credit risk on over--counter             derivatives
 but this is captured by one of  methods set out in cre52 and             mar50
           
4
 the funding of commodities positions may well open a bank to interest rate             or foreign exchange exposure and if  is so  relevant positions should             be included in  measures of interest rate and foreign exchange risk             described in mar20

 may be omitted from  commodities risk                     calculation although y will be subject to interest rate and                     counterparty risk requirements
      20
65 there are two alternatives for measuring commodities position risk under         standardised approach which are described in mar20
67 to mar20
72 below
        commodities risk can be measured using eir  maturity ladder approach
        which is a measurement system which captures forward gap and interest rate risk        separately by basing  methodology on seven time-bands as set out in mar20
        67 to mar20
70 below
 or  simplified approach
 which is a very simple        framework as set out in mar20
71 and mar20
72 below
 both  maturity        ladder approach and  simplified approach are appropriate only for banks        which
 in relative terms
 conduct only a limited amount of commodities business
        major traders would be expected to adopt a models approach subject to         safeguards set out in mar30
    20
66 for  maturity ladder approach and  simplified approach
 long and short        positions in each commodity may be reported on a net basis for  purposes of        calculating open positions
 however
 positions in different commodities will as a        general rule not be offsettable in this fashion
 neverless
 national authorities        will have discretion to permit netting between different sub-categories of         same commodity in cases where  sub-categories are deliverable against each        or
 they can also be considered as offsettable if y are close substitutes        against each or and a minimum correlation of 0
9 between  price        movements can be clearly established over a minimum period of one year
        however
 a bank wishing to base its calculation of capital requirements for        commodities on correlations would have to satisfy  relevant supervisory        authority of  accuracy of  method which has been chosen and obtain its        prior approval
 where banks use  models approach y can offset long and        short positions in different commodities to a degree which is determined by        empirical correlations
 in  same way as a limited degree of offsetting is        allowed
 for instance
 between interest rates in different currencies
         commodities can be grouped into clans
 families
 sub-groups and                     individual commodities
 for example
 a clan might be energy                     commodities
 within which hydro-carbons are a family with crude oil                     being a sub-group and west texas intermediate
 arabian light and                     brent being individual commodities
        maturity ladder approach    20
67 in calculating  capital requirements under  maturity ladder approach banks        will first have to express each commodity position 
spot plus forward
 in terms of         standard unit of measurement 
barrels
 kilos
 grams etc
""
 the net position in        each commodity will n be converted at current spot rates into  national        currency

       band 
which

" are sometimes referred to as curvature/spread risk"
""
        matched long and short positions in each time-band will carry a capital        requirement
 the methodology is similar to  used for interest-rate-related        instruments as set out in mar20
2 to mar20
39
 positions in  separate        commodities 
expressed in terms of  standard unit of measurement
 will first        be entered into a maturity ladder while physical stocks should be allocated to         first time-band
 a separate maturity ladder will be used for each commodity as        defined in mar20
66 above
 for each time-band as set out in  table 10
         sum of short and long positions which are matched will be multiplied first by         spot price for  commodity

 however
 recognising         such hedging of positions among different time-bands is imprecise
 a surcharge        equal to 0
6% of  net position carried forward will be added in respect of each        time-band   net position is carried forward
 the capital requirement for        each matched amount created by carrying net positions forward will be        calculated as in mar20

 at  end of this process a bank will have        eir only long or only short positions
 to which a capital requirement of 15%        will apply
    20
70 all commodity derivatives and off-balance-sheet positions which are affected by        changes in commodity prices should be included in this measurement framework
        this includes commodity futures
 commodity swaps and options where  delta
       plus method is used 
see mar20
76 to mar20
79 below
""
 in order to calculate         risk
 commodity derivatives should be converted into notional commodities        positions and assigned to maturities as follows
             
1
 futures and forward contracts relating to individual commodities should be             incorporated as notional amounts of  standard unit of measurement             
barrels
 kilos
 grams etc
 and should be assigned a maturity with reference             to expiry date
           
2
 commodity swaps where one leg is a fixed price and  or  current             market price should be incorporated as a series of positions equal to              notional amount of  contract
 with one position corresponding with each             payment on  swap and slotted into  maturity ladder accordingly
 the             positions would be long positions if  bank is paying fixed and receiving             floating
 and short positions if  bank is receiving fixed and paying floating
                           
3
 commodity swaps where  legs are in different commodities are to be             incorporated in  relevant maturity ladder
 no offsetting will be allowed in             this regard except where  commodities belong to  same sub-category             as defined in mar20
66 above
           for banks using or approaches to measure options risk
 all options                     and  associated underlyings should be excluded from both                      maturity ladder approach and  simplified approach
"    if one of  legs involves receiving/paying a fixed or floating interest                     rate"
  exposure should be slotted into  appropriate repricing                     maturity band in  maturity ladder covering interest rate related                     instruments

      treatment of options  20
73 in recognition of  wide diversity of banks activities in options and         difficulties of measuring price risk for options
 two alternative approaches will be        permissible at  discretion of  national authority under  standardised        approach
           
1
 those banks which solely use purchased options can use  simplified             approach described in mar20
75 below
           
2
 those banks which also write options are expected to use  delta-plus             method or scenario approach which are  intermediate approaches as set             out in mar20
76 to mar20
85
 the more significant its trading activity is
              more  bank will be expected to use a sophisticated approach
 and a bank             with highly significant trading activity is expected to use  internal models             approach using a comprehensive risk management model as set out in             mar30
     unless all ir written option positions are hedged by perfectly                     matched long positions in exactly  same options
 in which case no                     capital requirement for market risk is required
  20
74 in  simplified approach for options
  positions for  options and         associated underlying
 cash or forward
 are not subject to  standardised        methodology but rar are carved-out and subject to separately calculated        capital requirements  incorporate both general market risk and specific risk
        the risk numbers thus generated are n added to  capital requirements for         relevant category
 ie interest-rate-related instruments
 equities
 foreign        exchange and commodities as described in mar20
2 to mar20
72
 the delta-plus        method uses  sensitivity parameters or greek letters associated with options        to measure ir market risk and capital requirements
 under this method
         delta-equivalent position of each option becomes part of  standardised        methodology set out in mar20
2 to mar20
72 with  delta-equivalent amount        subject to  applicable general market risk charges
 separate capital        requirements are n applied to  gamma and vega risks of  option        positions
 the scenario approach uses simulation techniques to calculate changes        in  value of an options portfolio for changes in  level and volatility of its        associated underlyings
 under this approach
  general market risk charge is        determined by  scenario grid 
ie  specified combination of underlying and        volatility changes
  produces  largest loss
 for  delta-plus method and         scenario approach  specific risk capital requirements are determined        separately by multiplying  delta-equivalent of each option by  specific risk        weights set out in mar20
2 to mar20
51
      simplified approach    20
75 banks which handle a limited range of purchased options can use  simplified        approach set out in table 9 below for particular trades
 as an example of how         calculation would work
 if a holder of 100 shares currently valued at $10 each        holds an equivalent put option with a strike price of $11
  capital requirement        would be
 $1
000 x 16% 
ie 8% specific plus 8% general market risk
 = $160
 less         amount  option is in  money 
$11 
$10
 x 100 = $100
 ie  capital        requirement would be $60
 a similar methodology applies for options whose        underlying is a foreign currency
 an interest rate related instrument or a        commodity
              simplified approach
 capital requirements                                           table 9                       position                                      treatment             long cash and long put or  short cash and long call  the capital requirement will be  market value of  underlying security multiplied by   sum of specific and general market risk charges for  underlying less  amount  option  is in  money 
if any
 bounded at zero  long call or long put  the capital requirement will be  lesser of
 
1
  market value of  underlying security  multiplied by  sum of specific and general market risk charges for  underlying and 
2
   market value of  option         in some cases such as foreign exchange
 it may be unclear which side                   is  underlying security
 this should be taken to be  asset which                   would be received if  option were exercised
 in addition  nominal                   value should be used for items where  market value of                    underlying instrument could be zero
 eg caps and floors
 swaptions
     some options 
eg where  underlying is an interest rate
 a currency                   or a commodity
 bear no specific risk but specific risk will be present in                    case of options on certain interest-rate-related instruments

      delta-plus method    20
76 banks which write options will be allowed to include delta-weighted options        positions within  standardised methodology set out in mar20
2 to mar20
72
        such options should be reported as a position equal to  market value of         underlying multiplied by  delta
 however
 since delta does not sufficiently        cover  risks associated with options positions
 banks will also be required to        measure gamma 
which measures  rate of change of delta
 and vega 
which        measures  sensitivity of  value of an option with respect to a change in        volatility
 sensitivities in order to calculate  total capital requirement
 these        sensitivities will be calculated according to an approved exchange model or to         banks proprietary options pricing model subject to oversight by  national        authority
        national authorities may wish to require banks doing business in                     certain classes of exotic options 
eg barriers
 digitals
 or in options at                      money  are close to expiry to use eir  scenario approach                     or  internal models alternative

 as set out in mar20
2 to mar20
        39
 under  following procedure
 a two-legged approach should be used as for        or derivatives
 requiring one entry at  time  underlying contract takes        effect and a second at  time  underlying contract matures
 for instance
 a        bought call option on a june three-month interest-rate future will in april be        considered
 on  basis of its delta-equivalent value
 to be a long position with a        maturity of five months and a short position with a maturity of two months
 the        written option will be similarly slotted as a long position with a maturity of two        months and a short position with a maturity of five months
 floating-rate        instruments with caps or floors will be treated as a combination of floating rate        securities and a series of european-style options
 for example
  holder of a        three-year floating rate bond indexed to six month libor with a cap of 15% will        treat it as
           
1
 a debt security  reprices in six months
 and           
2
 a series of five written call options on a fra with a reference rate of 15%
             each with a negative sign at  time  underlying fra takes effect and a             positive sign at  time  underlying fra matures
          a two months call option on a bond future where delivery of  bond                     takes place in september would be considered in april as being long                      bond and short a five months deposit
 both positions being delta
                    weighted
    the rules applying to closely matched positions set out in mar20
35                     will also apply in this respect
      20
78 the capital requirement for options with equities as  underlying will also be        based on  delta-weighted positions which will be incorporated in  measure        of equity risk described in mar20
40 to mar20
51
 for purposes of this        calculation each national market is to be treated as a separate underlying
 the        capital requirement for options on foreign exchange and gold positions will be        based on  method for foreign exchange rate risk as set out in mar20
52 to        mar20

 for delta risk
  net delta-based equivalent of  foreign currency        and gold options will be incorporated into  measurement of  exposure for         respective currency 
or gold
 position
 the capital requirement for options on        commodities will be based on  simplified or  maturity ladder approach for        commodities risk as set out in mar20
62 to mar20
72
 the delta-weighted        positions will be incorporated in one of  measures described in  section
    20
79 in addition to  above capital requirements arising from delta risk
 re are        furr capital requirements for gamma and for vega risk
 banks using  delta
       plus method will be required to calculate  gamma and vega for each option        position 
including hedge positions
 separately
 the capital requirements should        be calculated in  following way
           
1
 for each individual option a gamma impact should be calculated according             to a taylor series expansion as follows
 where vu is  variation of              underlying of  option
           
2
 vu is calculated as follows
             
a
 for interest rate options if  underlying is a bond
  market value of                underlying should be multiplied by  risk weights set out in               mar20
25
 an equivalent calculation should be carried out where                underlying is an interest rate
 again based on  assumed changes in                corresponding yield in mar20
25
             
b
 for options on equities and equity indices
  market value of                underlying should be multiplied by 8%
             
c
   for foreign exchange and gold options
  market value of                  underlying should be multiplied by 8%
 and             
d
 for options on commodities
  market value of  underlying should               be multiplied by 15%

 each option on  same underlying will have a gamma impact  is eir           positive or negative
 these individual gamma impacts will be summed
           resulting in a net gamma impact for each underlying  is eir positive or           negative
 only those net gamma impacts  are negative will be included           in  capital requirement calculation
         
5
 the total gamma risk capital requirement will be  sum of  absolute           value of  net negative gamma impacts as calculated above

 for volatility risk
 banks will be required to calculate  capital requirements           by multiplying  sum of  vega risks for all options on  same           underlying
 as defined above
 by a proportional shift in volatility of  25%
         
7
 the total capital requirement for vega risk will be  sum of  absolute           value of  individual capital requirements  have been calculated for           vega risk
           the basic rules set out here for interest rate and equity options do not                     attempt to capture specific risk when calculating gamma capital                     requirements
 however
 national authorities may wish to require                     specific banks to do so
      positions have to be slotted into separate maturity ladders by currency
       banks using  duration method should use  time-bands as set out                     in mar20
28
        scenario approach    20
80 more sophisticated banks may opt to base  market risk capital requirement for        options portfolios and associated hedging positions on scenario matrix analysis
        this will be accomplished by specifying a fixed range of changes in  option        portfolios risk factors and calculating changes in  value of  option portfolio        at various points along this grid
 for  purpose of calculating  capital        requirement
  bank will revalue  option portfolio using matrices for        simultaneous changes in  options underlying rate or price and in  volatility        of  rate or price
 a different matrix will be set up for each individual        underlying as defined in mar20
79
 as an alternative
 at  discretion of each        national authority
 banks which are significant traders in options will for interest
       rate options be permitted to base  calculation on a minimum of six sets of        time-bands
 when using this method
 not more than three of  time-bands as        defined in mar20
25 and mar20
28 should be combined into any one set
    20
81 the options and related hedging positions will be evaluated over a specified        range above and below  current value of  underlying
 the range for interest        rates is consistent with  assumed changes in yield in mar20
25
 those banks        using  alternative method for interest rate options set out in mar20
80 above        should use
 for each set of time-bands
  highest of  assumed changes in        yield applicable to  group to which  time-bands belong
 the or ranges        are  8% for equities
  8% for foreign exchange and gold
 and  15% for        commodities
 for all risk categories
 at least seven observations 
including         current observation
 should be used to divide  range into equally spaced        intervals
          if
 for example
  time-bands 3 to 4 years
 4 to 5 years and 5 to 7                     years are combined  highest assumed change in yield of se three                     bands would be 0
75
     the basic rules set out here for interest rate and equity options do not                     attempt to capture specific risk when calculating gamma capital                     requirements
 however
 national authorities may wish to require                     specific banks to do so
      20
82 the second dimension of  matrix entails a change in  volatility of         underlying rate or price
 a single change in  volatility of  underlying rate or        price equal to a shift in volatility of 
25% and
25% is expected to be sufficient in        most cases
 as circumstances warrant
 however
"  supervisory authority may        choose to require  a different change in volatility be used and/or         intermediate points on  grid be calculated"
    20
83 after calculating  matrix each cell contains  net profit or loss of  option        and  underlying hedge instrument
 the capital requirement for each        underlying will n be calculated as  largest loss contained in  matrix
    20
84 the application of  scenario analysis by any specific bank will be subject to        supervisory consent
 particularly as regards  precise way   analysis is        constructed
 banks use of scenario analysis as part of  standardised        methodology will also be subject to validation by  national authority

 and ta 
rate of change of  value of         option with respect to time
""
 while not proposing a measurement system for        those risks at present
 it expects banks undertaking significant options business at         very least to monitor such risks closely

2   the use of an internal model will be conditional upon  explicit approval of          banks supervisory authority
 home and host country supervisory authorities of         banks  carry out material trading activities in multiple jurisdictions intend to         work co-operatively to ensure an efficient approval process
 the supervisory         authority will only give its approval if at a minimum
           
1
 it is satisfied   banks risk management system is conceptually sound             and is implemented with integrity

 and if necessary
 back office areas
           
3
 the banks models have in  supervisory authoritys judgement a proven             track record of reasonable accuracy in measuring risk
           
4
 the bank regularly conducts stress tests along  lines discussed in mar30

      qualitative standards  30
5   it is important  supervisory authorities are able to assure mselves          banks using models have market risk management systems  are conceptually         sound and implemented with integrity
 accordingly
  supervisory authority will         specify a number of qualitative criteria  banks would have to meet before         y are permitted to use a models-based approach
 the extent to which banks         meet  qualitative criteria may influence  level at which supervisory         authorities will set  multiplication factor referred to in mar30
16
 only those         banks whose models are in full compliance with  qualitative criteria will be         eligible for application of  minimum multiplication factor
 the qualitative         criteria include
           
1
 the bank should have an independent risk control unit  is responsible for            design and implementation of  banks risk management system
 the           unit should produce and analyse daily reports on  output of  banks           risk measurement model
 including an evaluation of  relationship           between measures of risk exposure and trading limits
 this unit must be           independent from business trading units and should report directly to senior           management of  bank
         
2
 the unit should conduct a regular back-testing programme
 ie an ex-post           comparison of  risk measure generated by  model against actual daily           changes in portfolio value over longer periods of time
 as well as           hypotical changes based on static positions
         
3
 the unit should also conduct  initial and on-going validation of            internal model
         
4
 board of directors and senior management should be actively involved in            risk control process and must regard risk control as an essential aspect of            business to which significant resources need to be devoted
 in this regard
            daily reports prepared by  independent risk control unit must be           reviewed by a level of management with sufficient seniority and authority to           enforce both reductions of positions taken by individual traders and           reductions in  banks overall risk exposure
         
5
 the banks internal risk measurement model must be closely integrated into            day-to-day risk management process of  bank
 its output should           accordingly be an integral part of  process of planning
 monitoring and           controlling  banks market risk profile
         
6
 the risk measurement system should be used in conjunction with internal           trading and exposure limits
 in this regard
 trading limits should be related to            banks risk measurement model in a manner  is consistent over time           and  is well understood by both traders and senior management
         
7
 a routine and rigorous programme of stress testing should be in place as a           supplement to  risk analysis based on  day-to-day output of  bank           s risk measurement model
 the results of stress testing should be reviewed           periodically by senior management
 used in  internal assessment of           capital adequacy
 and reflected in  policies and limits set by management           and  board of directors
 where stress tests reveal particular vulnerability           to a given set of circumstances
 prompt steps should be taken to manage           those risks appropriately 
eg by hedging against  outcome or reducing            size of  banks exposures
 or increasing capital
""
             
8
 banks should have a routine in place for ensuring compliance with a           documented set of internal policies
 controls and procedures concerning            operation of  risk measurement system
 the banks risk measurement           system must be well documented
 for example
 through a risk management           manual  describes  basic principles of  risk management system           and  provides an explanation of  empirical techniques used to           measure market risk
         
9
 an independent review of  risk measurement system should be carried           out regularly in  banks own internal auditing process
 this review should           include both  activities of  business trading units and of            independent risk control unit
 a review of  overall risk management           process should take place at regular intervals 
ideally not less than once a           year
 and should specifically address
 at a minimum
             
a
 the adequacy of  documentation of  risk management system               and process

25
        specification of market risk factors  30
6   an important part of a banks internal market risk measurement system is          specification of an appropriate set of market risk factors
 ie  market rates and         prices  affect  value of  banks trading positions
 the risk factors         contained in a market risk measurement system should be sufficient to capture          risks inherent in  banks portfolio of on
and off-balance sheet trading         positions
 although banks will have some discretion in specifying  risk factors         for ir internal models
  following guidelines should be fulfilled
    30
7   factors  are deemed relevant for pricing should be included as risk factors in          value-at-risk model
 where a risk factor is incorporated in a pricing model but         not in  value-at-risk model
  bank must justify this omission to          satisfaction of its supervisor
 in addition
  value-at-risk model must capture         nonlinearities for options and or relevant products 
eg mortgage-backed         securities
 tranched exposures or n-th-to-default credit derivatives
""
 as well as         correlation risk and basis risk 
eg between credit default swaps and bonds

         moreover
  supervisor has to be satisfied  proxies are used which show a         good track record for  actual position held 
ie an equity index for a position in         an individual stock

 can                     non-correlation trading securitisations be incorporated in an internal                     models approach?                       securitisations which are not part of  correlation trading portfolio                     are subject to a general market risk capital requirement and                      standardised capital requirement for specific risk
 these positions must                     be included in  banks var model for general market risk or be                     subject to  standardised approach capital requirement for general                     market risk
 while  positions may be included in  banks internal                     specific risk model
  specific risk capital requirement for                     securitisations according to  standardised approach will apply as                     well
      30
8   for interest rates
 re must be a set of risk factors corresponding to interest         rates in each currency in which  bank has interest-rate-sensitive on
or off
        balance sheet positions
           
1
 the risk measurement system should model  yield curve using one of a             number of generally accepted approaches
 for example
 by estimating             forward rates of zero coupon yields
 the yield curve should be divided into             various maturity segments in order to capture variation in  volatility of             rates along  yield curve
 re will typically be one risk factor             corresponding to each maturity segment
 for material exposures to interest             rate movements in  major currencies and markets
 banks must model              yield curve using a minimum of six risk factors
 however
  number of risk             factors used should ultimately be driven by  nature of  banks trading             strategies
 for instance
 a bank with a portfolio of various types of securities             across many points of  yield curve and  engages in complex arbitrage             strategies would require a greater number of risk factors to capture interest             rate risk accurately
               
2
 the risk measurement system must incorporate separate risk factors to             capture spread risk 
eg between bonds and swaps
""
 a variety of approaches             may be used to capture  spread risk arising from less than perfectly             correlated movements between government and or fixed-income interest             rates
 such as specifying a completely separate yield curve for non
            government fixed-income instruments 
for instance
 swaps or municipal             securities
 or estimating  spread over government rates at various points             along  yield curve
    30
9   for exchange rates 
which may include gold
""
  risk measurement system         should incorporate risk factors corresponding to  individual foreign currencies         in which  banks positions are denominated
 since  value-at-risk figure         calculated by  risk measurement system will be expressed in  banks         domestic currency
 any net position denominated in a foreign currency will         introduce a foreign exchange risk
 thus
 re must be risk factors corresponding         to  exchange rate between  domestic currency and each foreign currency in         which  bank has a significant exposure
    30
10 for equity prices
 re should be risk factors corresponding to each of  equity        markets in which  bank holds significant positions
           
1
 at a minimum
 re should be a risk factor  is designed to capture             market-wide movements in equity prices 
eg a market index
""
 positions in             individual securities or in sector indices could be expressed in beta
            equivalents relative to this market-wide index
           
2
 a somewhat more detailed approach would be to have risk factors             corresponding to various sectors of  overall equity market 
for instance
             industry sectors or cyclical and non-cyclical sectors
""
 as above
 positions in             individual stocks within each sector could be expressed in beta-equivalents             relative to  sector index
           
3
 the most extensive approach would be to have risk factors corresponding to              volatility of individual equity issues
           
4
 the sophistication and nature of  modelling technique for a given market             should correspond to  banks exposure to  overall market as well as its             concentration in individual equity issues in  market
          a beta-equivalent position would be calculated from a market model                     of equity price returns 
such as  capital asset pricing model
 by                     regressing  return on  individual stock or sector index on  risk
                    free rate of return and  return on  market index
      30
11 for commodity prices
 re should be risk factors corresponding to each of         commodity markets in which  bank holds significant positions 
also see        mar20
70
""
           
1
 for banks with relatively limited positions in commodity-based instruments
             a straightforward specification of risk factors would be acceptable
 such a             specification would likely entail one risk factor for each commodity price to             which  bank is exposed
 in cases where  aggregate positions are quite             small
 it might be acceptable to use a single risk factor for a relatively broad             sub-category of commodities 
for instance
 a single risk factor for all types of             oil

 for more active trading
  model must also take account of variation in              convenience yield between derivatives positions such as forwards and             swaps and cash positions in  commodity
    the convenience yield reflects  benefits from direct ownership of                      physical commodity

12 it is essential   methodology used for commodities risk encompasses
           
1
 directional risk
 to capture  exposure from changes in spot prices arising             from net open positions
           
2
 forward gap and interest rate risk
 to capture  exposure to changes in             forward prices arising from maturity mismatches

3
 basis risk
 to capture  exposure to changes in  price relationships             between two similar
 but not identical
 commodities
    30

 individual banks or ir supervisory authorities will have        discretion to apply stricter standards
           
1
 value-at-risk must be computed on a daily basis
           
2
 in calculating  value-at-risk
 a 99th percentile
 one-tailed confidence             interval is to be used
           
3
 in calculating value-at-risk
 an instantaneous price shock equivalent to a 10             day movement in prices is to be used
 ie  minimum holding period will             be ten trading days
 banks may use value-at-risk numbers calculated             according to shorter holding periods scaled up to ten days by
 for example
              square root of time

 banks must update ir data sets no less frequently than once every month             and also reassess m whenever market prices are subject to material             changes
 this updating process must be flexible enough to allow for more             frequent updates
 the supervisory authority may also require a bank to             calculate its value-at-risk using a shorter observation period if
 in              supervisors judgement
 this is justified by a significant upsurge in price             volatility

 banks will be free to use models based
 for example
 on variance
            covariance matrices
 historical simulations
 or monte carlo simulations

 banks will have discretion to recognise empirical correlations within broad           risk categories 
eg interest rates
 exchange rates
 equity prices and           commodity prices
 including related options volatilities in each risk factor           category

 the supervisory authority may also recognise empirical           correlations across broad risk factor categories

 banks models must accurately capture  unique risks associated with           options within each of  broad risk categories
 the following criteria apply           to  measurement of options risk
             
a
 banks models must capture  non-linear price characteristics of               options positions
             
b
 banks are expected to ultimately move towards  application of a full               10 day price shock to options positions or positions  display option
              like characteristics
 in  interim
 national authorities may require banks               to adjust ir capital measure for options risk through or methods
               eg periodic simulations or stress testing
             
c
   each banks risk measurement system must have a set of risk factors                  captures  volatilities of  rates and prices underlying option                 positions
 ie vega risk
" banks with relatively large and/or complex                 options portfolios should have detailed specifications of  relevant                 volatilities"
 this means  banks should measure  volatilities of                 options positions broken down by different maturities

 in addition
 a bank must calculate a stressed value-at-risk 
svar

           this measure is intended to replicate a value-at-risk calculation  would           be generated on  banks current portfolio if  relevant market factors           were experiencing a period of stress
 and should refore be based on            10-day
 99th percentile
 one-tailed confidence interval value-at-risk measure           of  current portfolio
 with model inputs calibrated to historical data from           a continuous 12-month period of significant financial stress relevant to            banks portfolio
 the period used must be approved by  supervisor and           regularly reviewed
 as an example
 for many portfolios
" a 12-month period           relating to significant losses in 2007/2008 would adequately reflect a period           of such stress"
 although or periods relevant to  current portfolio must           be considered by  bank

 in principle
                  easiest way to do this is to run  current var model based on                 historical data from a period of financial stress
 however
 re are two                 particular cases where this might be inappropriate
                   
if a period of financial stress 
which may be indicated by                   significantly higher volatilities
 corresponds to directional moves                   which would lead to  bank making money
 based on  current                   portfolio
 in se circumstances
 it might be appropriate to apply                    risk factor movements in both  direction which is indicated                   by  historical data
 and  opposite direction 
anti-tic
 to                   ensure   period of high volatility becomes more relevant to                    banks portfolio
                   
in stressed periods
 re are some price factors 
eg credit spreads
                   which tend to have higher absolute values
 therefore
 an increase in                   absolute volatility in se factors 
ie large movements
 might not                   correspond to significant increases in relative volatility 
ie because                    absolute level of  parameter is also higher
""
 if  banks                   current var model tracks relative shifts in se price factors
 n                    relevant period of stress applied in benign periods 
ie when                    absolute values of credit spreads are smaller
 might not deliver a                   var measure which accurately reflects what  var would be in a                   period of stress
 the bank should refore consider modifying its                   var model to account for large absolute factor moves  can                   occur in times of stress
                   this does not mean   bank needs to look at a different 250-day                 period or an additional 250-day period by changing  sign of risk                 factor movements
 but  it needs to think intelligently about how it                 translates  data from a 250-day period of stress into a svar                 measure
         faq9      is  svar also subject to a use-test?                          yes
  var engine used to generate svar is subject to a use-test                    through  use of  current var calculated using  same engine
                    however
 it may be   svar output is not used in  day-to-day                    risk management decisions
 because a different var measure is used
             faq10      taking into account  both migration and default risks have to be                    captured in  incremental risk capital requirement
 is it necessary to                    still model default and migration in var and svar?                      not necessarily
                      mar30 footnote 7 states 
 for specific risk modelling
 banks need                    not capture default and migration risks for positions subject to                     incremental risk capital requirement referred to in mar30
33 and                    mar30
34
 this is also  case for svar
 since var and svar                    methodologies should be aligned
                      at  same time specific risk for credit spread models are meant to                    capture idiosyncratic risk in terms of credit spreads
 specific risk models                    can include spread jumps and may refore include rating migrations
                    the same applies to var and svar though  impact in svar may be                    greater than in var

 credit
 and        operational risks
 stress scenarios need to shed light on  impact of such events        on positions  display both linear and nonlinear price characteristics

""
    30
20 banks stress tests should be both of a quantitative and qualitative nature
        incorporating both market risk and liquidity aspects of market disturbances
        quantitative criteria should identify plausible stress scenarios to which banks        could be exposed
 qualitative criteria should emphasise  two major goals of        stress testing are to evaluate  capacity of  banks capital to absorb potential        large losses and to identify steps  bank can take to reduce its risk and        conserve capital
 this assessment is integral to setting and evaluating  banks        management strategy and  results of stress testing should be routinely        communicated to senior management and
 periodically
 to  banks board of        directors
    30
21 banks should combine  use of supervisory stress scenarios with stress tests        developed by banks mselves to reflect ir specific risk characteristics

 this loss information could be compared to         level of capital  results from a banks internal measurement system

 it could provide supervisory authorities with a picture of how many days        of peak day losses would have been covered by a given value-at-risk estimate

 but                      does not preclude individual supervisors asking for information in                     different forms
      30
23 scenarios requiring a simulation by  bank
 banks should subject ir        portfolios to a series of simulated stress scenarios and provide supervisory        authorities with  results
 these scenarios could include testing  current        portfolio against past periods of significant disturbance
 for example
  1987        equity crash
  exchange rate mechanism crises of 1992 and 1993
  fall in        bond markets in  first quarter of 1994
  1998 russian financial crisis
"         2000 bursting of  technology stock bubble or  2007/2008 sub-prime crisis"
        incorporating both  large price movements and  sharp reduction in        liquidity associated with se events
 a second type of scenario would evaluate         sensitivity of  banks market risk exposure to changes in  assumptions        about volatilities and correlations
 applying this test would require an evaluation        of  historical range of variation for volatilities and correlations and evaluation        of  banks current positions against  extreme values of  historical range
        due consideration should be given to  sharp variation  at times has        occurred in a matter of days in periods of significant market disturbance
 for        example
  above-mentioned situations involved correlations within risk factors        approaching  extreme values of 1 or
1 for several days at  height of         disturbance
    30
24 scenarios developed by  bank itself to capture  specific characteristics of its        portfolio
 in addition to  scenarios prescribed by supervisory authorities under        mar30
22 and mar30
23
 a bank should also develop its own stress tests which it        identifies as most adverse based on  characteristics of its portfolio 
eg        problems in a key region of  world combined with a sharp move in oil prices
""
        banks should provide supervisory authorities with a description of         methodology used to identify and carry out  scenarios as well as with a        description of  results derived from se scenarios
      30
25 the results should be reviewed periodically by senior management and should be        reflected in  policies and limits set by management and  board of directors
        moreover
 if  testing reveals particular vulnerability to a given set of        circumstances
  national authorities would expect  bank to take prompt        steps to manage those risks appropriately 
eg by hedging against  outcome        or reducing  size of its exposures

        model validation standards  30
27 it is important  banks have processes in place to ensure  ir internal        models have been adequately validated by suitably qualified parties independent        of  development process to ensure  y are conceptually sound and        adequately capture all material risks
 this validation should be conducted when         model is initially developed and when any significant changes are made to         model
 the validation should also be conducted on a periodic basis but        especially where re have been any significant structural changes in  market        or changes to  composition of  portfolio which might lead to  model no        longer being adequate
 more extensive model validation is particularly important        where specific risk is also modelled and is required to meet  furr specific        risk criteria
 as techniques and best practices evolve
 banks should avail        mselves of se advances
 model validation should not be limited to        backtesting
 but should
 at a minimum
 also include  following
           
1
 tests to demonstrate  any assumptions made within  internal model             are appropriate and do not underestimate risk
 this may include              assumption of  normal distribution
  use of  square root of time to             scale from a one day holding period to a 10 day holding period or where             extrapolation or interpolation techniques are used
 or pricing models

 furr to  regulatory backtesting programmes
 testing for model             validation must use hypotical changes in portfolio value  would occur             were end-of-day positions to remain unchanged
 it refore excludes fees
             commissions
 bid-ask spreads
 net interest income and intra-day trading
             moreover
 additional tests are required which may include
 for instance
               
a
 testing carried out for longer periods than required for  regular                 backtesting programme 
eg 3 years
""
 the longer time period generally                 improves  power of  backtesting
 a longer time period may not                 be desirable if  var model or market conditions have changed to                  extent  historical data is no longer relevant
               
b
 testing carried out using confidence intervals or than  99 percent                 interval required under  quantitative standards
               
c
   testing of portfolios below  overall bank level
               
3
 the use of hypotical portfolios to ensure   model is able to             account for particular structural features  may arise
 for example
                
a
 where data histories for a particular instrument do not meet                   quantitative standards in mar30
14 to mar30
17 and where  bank                  has to map se positions to proxies
 n  bank must ensure                        proxies produce conservative results under relevant market                    scenarios
                
b
 ensuring  material basis risks are adequately captured
 this may                  include mismatches between long and short positions by maturity or by                  issuer

      treatment of specific risk  30
28 the criteria for supervisory recognition of banks modelling of specific risk require         a banks model must capture all material components of price risk and be        responsive to changes in market conditions and compositions of portfolios
 in        particular
  model must
           
1
 explain  historical price variation in  portfolio
           
2
 capture concentrations 
magnitude and changes in composition
""
           
3
 be robust to an adverse environment
           
4
 capture name-related basis risk
           
5
 capture event risk
           
6
 be validated through backtesting
    banks need not capture default and migration risks for positions                   subject to  incremental risk capital requirement referred to in                   mar30
33 and mar30
34
     the key ex ante measures of model quality are goodness-of-fit                   measures which address  question of how much of  historical                   variation in price value is explained by  risk factors included within                    model
 one measure of this type which can often be used is an r
                  squared measure from regression methodology
 if this measure is to be                   used
  risk factors included in  banks model would be expected                   to be able to explain a high percentage
 such as 90%
 of  historical                   price variation or  model should explicitly include estimates of                    residual variability not captured in  factors included in this                   regression
 for some types of models
 it may not be feasible to                   calculate a goodness-of-fit measure
 in such instance
 a bank is                   expected to work with its national supervisor to define an acceptable                   alternative measure which would meet this regulatory objective
    the bank would be expected to demonstrate   model is sensitive                   to changes in portfolio construction and  higher capital                   requirements are attracted for portfolios  have increasing                   concentrations in particular names or sectors
   the bank should be able to demonstrate   model will signal                   rising risk in an adverse environment
 this could be achieved by                   incorporating in  historical estimation period of  model at least                   one full credit cycle and ensuring   model would not have been                   inaccurate in  downward portion of  cycle
 anor approach for                   demonstrating this is through simulation of historical or plausible                   worst-case environments
     banks should be able to demonstrate   model is sensitive to                   material idiosyncratic differences between similar but not identical                   positions
 for example debt positions with different levels of                   subordination
 maturity mismatches
 or credit derivatives with different                   default events
     for equity positions
 events  are reflected in large changes or jumps                   in prices must be captured
" eg merger break-ups/takeovers"
 in                   particular
 firms must consider issues related to survivorship bias
     aimed at assessing wher specific risk
 as well as general market risk
                   is being captured adequately
  30
"29 the bank  model must conservatively assess  risk arising from less liquid        positions and/or positions with limited price transparency under realistic market        scenarios"
 in addition
  model must meet minimum data standards
 proxies        may be used only where available data is insufficient or is not reflective of         true volatility of a position or portfolio
 and only where y are appropriately        conservative
    30
30 furr
 as techniques and best practices evolve
 banks should avail mselves of        se advances
    30
31 banks which apply modelled estimates of specific risk are required to conduct        backtesting aimed at assessing wher specific risk is being accurately captured
        the methodology a bank should use for validating its specific risk estimates is to        perform separate backtests on sub-portfolios using daily data on subportfolios        subject to specific risk
 the key sub-portfolios for this purpose are traded-debt        and equity positions
 however
 if a bank itself decomposes its trading portfolio        into finer categories 
eg emerging markets
 traded corporate debt
 etc
""
""
 it is        appropriate to keep se distinctions for sub-portfolio backtesting purposes
        banks are required to commit to a sub-portfolio structure and stick to it unless it        can be demonstrated to  supervisor  it would make sense to change         structure
    30
32 banks are required to have in place a process to analyse exceptions identified        through  backtesting of specific risk
 this process is intended to serve as         fundamental way in which banks correct ir models of specific risk in  event        y become inaccurate
 there will be a presumption  models         incorporate specific risk are unacceptable if  results at  sub-portfolio level        produce a number of exceptions commensurate with  red zone as defined in        mar99
 banks with unacceptable specific risk models are expected to take        immediate action to correct  problem in  model and to ensure  re is        a sufficient capital buffer to absorb  risk   backtest showed had not        been adequately captured
      incremental risk capital requirement and comprehensive risk measure    overview of  incremental risk capital requirement      30
33 in addition
  bank must have an approach in place to capture in its regulatory        capital default risk and migration risk in positions subject to a capital requirement        for specific interest rate risk
 with  exception of securitisation exposures and n
       th-to-default credit derivatives

 regardless of ir perceived liquidity
           faq       faq1      should sovereign bonds be included in  irc requirement?                   yes
                   the definition of specific risk in mar20
4
 is quite generic
                 consequently
 it does not scope out any particular securities
 when an                 acceptable irc model identifies sovereign bonds as subject to                 migration and default risk
  capital requirement should be                 determined accordingly
 even if certain sovereign bonds are subject to                 a risk weight of 0% under  standardised approach mar20
5
 y                 cannot be considered as free of default and migration risk
 therefore
                 sovereign risk should be included in  scope of  incremental risk                 capital requirement
 sovereign bonds must refore be included in                  relevant model
 a general partial use of  standardised approach for                 sovereign bonds
 ie exclusion of positions subject to a risk weight of 0%                 under  standardised approach from irc requirement
 will not be                 granted
 accordingly
 y will attract a capital requirement under                  irc
 except where  output of  model happens not to imply a                 capital requirement for se positions
         faq2      should pfandbriefe 
ie debt securities backed by cash flows from                 mortgage or public sector loans
 be excluded from irc requirement?                   pfandbriefe and or covered bonds  do not qualify as                 securitisations should be included in irc requirement
         faq3      should banks exclude positions 
eg bonds
 structured notes
 issued by                 or group members from irc requirement?                   no
 positions issued by or group members should be included in                  irc requirement to ensure   irc captures a complete view of                 default and migration risk in  trading book
         faq4      should repos and reverse repos be included in  irc requirement
 or                  comprehensive risk measure?                   yes
 a security used in a sale and repurchase agreement 
repo
                 transaction should still attract a charge under  irc requirement or                  comprehensive risk measure 
 if it were to attract a capital                 requirement under  rules for market risk
 including specific risk
 this                 is because  repo transaction does not alter  migration or default                 risk from  point of  seller of  security
 receiving a security                         through a reverse repo transaction will not
 by itself
 create a position                     in  security
 the migration or default risk stays with  seller of                      security
           faq5        should bonds  have already defaulted be excluded from irc                     requirement? what about credit default swaps 
cds
  reference                     defaulted bonds?                       no
 bonds  have defaulted may increase in value
 or may be                     substituted by anor bond  increases in value
 later on
 also
                      lack of a consistent and uniform definition of default makes it                     difficult to exclude positions based on this criterion
 as long as                      bond is held in  trading account it should be included in  irc                     requirement
 in terms of a cds contract referencing a defaulted bond
                     se should also be included in  irc requirement until such time                      settlement occurs
 if a credit event is deemed to occur by                      determination committee and settlement occurs n it can be                     removed from  irc requirement model
      30
45 with supervisory approval
 a bank can choose consistently to include all listed        equity and derivatives positions based on listed equity of a desk in its incremental        risk model when such inclusion is consistent with how  bank internally        measures and manages this risk at  trading desk level
 if equity securities are        included in  computation of incremental risk
 default is deemed to occur if         related debt defaults

46 however
 when computing  irc requirement
 a bank is not permitted to        incorporate into its irc requirement model any securitisation positions
 even        when securitisation positions are viewed as hedging underlying credit        instruments held in  trading account
    30
47 for irc requirement-covered positions
  irc requirement captures
           
1
 default risk
 this means  potential for direct loss due to an obligor              default as well as  potential for indirect losses  may arise from a             default event
           
2
 credit migration risk
" this means  potential for direct loss due to an             internal/external rating downgrade or upgrade as well as  potential for             indirect losses  may arise from a credit migration event"
           faq       faq1      when we talk about migration risk captured in  irc requirement
 is                 it  risk of a downgrade of  internal rating  a bank gives to a                 debtor in  irb framework
 or is it  risk of  downgrade of an                 external rating of a debtor in  trading book? if it is external
 should                  bank choose a rating agency as  standard for  definition of                 migration?                   the credit migration risk part of  capital requirement can be                 determined on  basis of migrations of internal or external ratings
                 the banks choice may be guided in particular by an assessment of                 which kind of ratings are closer related to  changes of credit spreads                   bank observes in  market
 the bank must apply its                 methodology in a consistent and well-reasoned way
 subject to this                 constraint  bank need not give priority to any particular external                 rating agency
         faq2      definition of migration risk as opposed to market risk
 migration risk is                 often modelled by assuming  a rating migration goes toger with                 a change in credit spread from  average spread level of rating 1 to                  average spread level of rating 2
" is this sufficient to cover migration                 risk in irc requirement or must irc requirement include  risk of                 losses due to temporary and/or idiosyncratic deviations of credit                 spreads from average spread levels? one could argue  se are                 market risks and are already captured in var"
 the question is                 particularly material in relation to  basis between long and short                 positions
                   it is acceptable to define migration risk as  risk of a change in credit                 spread from an average spread level 1 to an average spread level 2
                 the reason is   basel framework implicitly includes a capital                 requirement for a change of credit spreads from rating migrations
 it                 does not include a capital requirement for changes of credit spreads                  may occur without a rating migration 
see mar30
34 and mar30
                 48
""
                   moreover
 it would be difficult to capture idiosyncratic risk in  one
                year irc requirement horizon
                   in  context of this question
  bank should specifically evaluate                  representativeness of  average spread levels
 mappings from ratings                 to credit spreads
 rating transition matrices
 spread homogeneity in                  partition class 
eg a rating group
 etc
                      the method for establishing ratings should fully reflect positions in                     banks portfolios
            faq3        taking into account  both migration and default risks have to be                    captured in irc requirement
 is it necessary to still model default and                    migration in var and svar?                      not necessarily
                      mar30 footnote 7 states 
 for specific risk modelling
 banks need                    not capture default and migration risks for positions subject to  iirc                    requirement referred to in mar30
33 and mar30
34
 this is also                     case for stressed var
 since var and svar methodologies should be                    aligned
                      at  same time specific risk for credit spread models are meant to                    capture idiosyncratic risk in terms of credit spreads
 specific risk models                    can include spread jumps and may refore include rating migrations
                    the same applies to var and svar though  impact in svar may be                    greater than in var
      30
48 for all irc requirement-covered positions
 a banks irc requirement model must        measure losses due to default and migration at  99
9 percent confidence        interval over a capital horizon of one year
 taking into account  liquidity        horizons applicable to individual trading positions or sets of positions
" losses        caused by broader market-wide events affecting multiple issues/issuers are        encompassed by this definition"

issuer
or position-specific
 estimates of loss                    rates

 banks should at                     least estimate ir impact on  irc requirement figure
 for instance
                     banks could compare approaches using issuer-specific downturn lgds                     
taken from  irb context
 with approaches relevant using historical                     market price movements of positions which are deemed representative

49 as described immediately below
 for each irc requirement-covered position         model should also capture  impact of rebalancing positions at  end of ir        liquidity horizons so as to achieve a constant level of risk over a one-year capital        horizon
 the model may incorporate correlation effects among  modelled risk        factors

9 percent confidence level
      irc requirement
 constant level of risk over one-year capital horizon    30
50 an irc requirement model should be based on  assumption of a constant        level of risk over  one-year capital horizon
      this assumption is consistent with  capital computations in  cre                     standard
 in all cases 
loans

""
  cre standard                     defines exposure at default in a way  reflects a roll-over of existing                     exposures when y mature
 the combination of  constant level of                     risk assumption and  one-year capital horizon reflects supervisors                     assessment of  appropriate capital needed to support  risk in                      trading portfolio
 it also reflects  importance to  financial                     markets of banks having  capital capacity to continue providing                     liquidity to  financial markets in spite of trading losses
 consistent                     with a going concern view of a bank
 this assumption is appropriate                     because a bank must continue to take risks to support its income
                    producing activities
 for regulatory capital adequacy purposes
 it is not                     appropriate to assume  a bank would reduce its var to zero at a                     short-term horizon in reaction to large trading losses
 it also is not                     appropriate to rely on  prospect  a bank could raise additional                     tier 1 capital during stressed market conditions
             30
51 this constant level of risk assumption implies  a bank rebalances
 or rolls        over
 its trading positions over  one-year capital horizon in a manner         maintains  initial risk level
 as indicated by a metric such as var or  profile        of exposure by credit rating and concentration
 this means incorporating         effect of replacing positions whose credit characteristics have improved or        deteriorated over  liquidity horizon with positions  have risk characteristics        equivalent to those   original position had at  start of  liquidity        horizon
 the frequency of  assumed rebalancing must be governed by         liquidity horizon for a given position
    30
52 rebalancing positions does not imply
 as  irb approach for  banking book        does
   same positions will be maintained throughout  capital horizon
        particularly for more liquid and more highly rated positions
 this provides a        benefit relative to  treatment under  irb framework
 however
 a bank may        elect to use a one-year constant position assumption
 as long as it does so        consistently across all portfolios
      irc requirement
 liquidity horizon    30
53 stressed credit market events have shown  firms cannot assume  markets        remain liquid under those conditions
 banks experienced significant illiquidity in a        wide range of credit products held in  trading book
 including leveraged loans
        under se circumstances
 liquidity in many parts of  securitisation markets        dried up
 forcing banks to retain exposures in securitisation pipelines for        prolonged periods of time
 the committee refore expects firms to pay        particular attention to  appropriate liquidity horizon assumptions within ir        irc requirement models
    30
54 the liquidity horizon represents  time required to sell  position or to hedge        all material risks covered by  irc requirement model in a stressed market
 the        liquidity horizon must be measured under conservative assumptions and should        be sufficiently long   act of selling or hedging
 in itself
 does not materially        affect market prices
 the determination of  appropriate liquidity horizon for a        position or set of positions may take into account a banks internal policies        relating to
 for example
 prudent valuation 
as per  prudent valuation guidance        of cap50
""
 valuation adjustments and  management of stale positions
     for establishing prudent valuation adjustments
 see also cap50
      30
55 the liquidity horizon for a position or set of positions has a floor of three months
    30
56 in general
 within a given product type a non-investment-grade position is        expected to have a longer assumed liquidity horizon than an investment-grade        position
 conservative assumptions regarding  liquidity horizon for non
       investment-grade positions are warranted until furr evidence is gained        regarding  markets liquidity during systematic and idiosyncratic stress        situations
 firms also need to apply conservative liquidity horizon assumptions for        products
 regardless of rating
 where secondary market liquidity is not deep
        particularly during periods of financial market volatility and investor risk aversion

58 the liquidity horizon is expected to be greater for positions  are        concentrated
 reflecting  longer period needed to liquidate such positions
        this longer liquidity horizon for concentrated positions is necessary to provide        adequate capital against two types of concentration
 issuer concentration and        market concentration
             faq         faq1        what is  link between  liquidity horizon and issuer                     concentration? would it be better to address issuer concentration                     through  correlation assumptions?                       no
 where a bank has concentrated positions in terms of  market                     this should be reflected in a longer liquidity horizon  consistent with                      view  it takes longer to liquidate concentrated positions
                     concentrated positions in terms of  banks portfolio would be                     reflected in  correlations inherent in  model

 correlations and diversification    30
59 economic and financial dependence among obligors causes a clustering of        default and migration events
 accordingly
  irc requirement includes         impact of correlations between default and migration events among obligors and        a banks irc requirement model must include  impact of such clustering of        default and migration events
        30
60          the impact of diversification between default or migration risks in  trading          book and or risks in  trading book is not currently well understood
          therefore
  impact of diversification between default or migration events and          or market variables would not be reflected in  computation of capital for          incremental risk
 this is consistent with  basel framework
 which does not          allow for  benefit of diversification when combining capital requirements for          credit risk and market risk
 accordingly
  capital requirement for incremental          default and migration losses is added to  var-based capital requirement for          market risk

1
 liquidity horizons should reflect actual practice and experience during             periods of both systematic and idiosyncratic stresses
           
2
 the irc requirement model for measuring default and migration risks over              liquidity horizon should take into account objective data over              relevant horizon and include comparison of risk estimates for a rebalanced             portfolio with  of a portfolio with fixed positions
           
3
 correlation assumptions must be supported by analysis of objective data in a           conceptually sound framework
 if a bank uses a multi-period model to           compute incremental risk
 it should evaluate  implied annual correlations           to ensure y are reasonable and in line with observed annual correlations
           a bank must validate  its modelling approach for correlations is           appropriate for its portfolio
 including  choice and weights of its                 systematic risk factors
 a bank must document its modelling approach so            its correlation and or modelling assumptions are transparent to           supervisors

 is a cds indirectly referencing a counterparty

                  cds will be recognised as in  market risk framework for var

                  recognition of  cds hedge will be done according to                        standardised measurement method in  market risk framework

faq6
 states
 any instrument of which                  associated payment depends on cross default 
such as a related entity                 hedged with a reference entity cds and cds triggers
 is not considered                 as an eligible hedge
 a question has arisen wher this means  a                 single-name cds cannot be recognised against an exposure to a                 related counterparty 
for example a sovereign cds against a province                 in  same country
 even if  var model captures  basis risk                 between  exposure and  hedge
 or was this clause aimed at                 instruments or than single-name cds
  pay out only if re is                 more than one default event
                   single
ame proxy hedges cannot be recognised in  advanced cva                 capital requirement
 irrespective of wher  basis risk between                  exposure and  hedge is appropriately captured in  model
 in fact
                 mar50
13 admits as eligible hedges only instruments 
such as cdss                 and contingent cdss
 referencing  counterparty directly or index                 cdss
 as an example
 consider an exposure to counterparty b with no                 cds traded on its name 
eg a province within a country
 whose spread                 is approximated by  of counterparty a 
eg  central government                 of  country
""
 the only eligible hedge of  exposure to                 counterparty b would be an index c containing counterparty a
                 provided  bank can incorporate  basis between c and a into its                 var model to  satisfaction of its supervisor
                              furr
 to  extent  single-name proxy hedges are not to be                    recognised in  advanced cva capital requirement on one hand
 but                    a proxy spread is required to be used whenever  relevant cds                    spread is not available on  or hand
 banks should be furr                    noted  y are prohibited from
 or should derecognise
 over                    hedging on a single-name level
                      to illustrate this
 in  above example
 whenever  bank over                    hedges its exposure to a
 se hedges on a will effectively act as a                    proxy hedge for  exposure to b
 this is true irrespective of wher b                    is mapped to  cds spread of a or not
 therefore
  firm should set                    a cap on  recognition of all single-name hedges

mtm
 changes  would be         experienced by  current correlation trading portfolio 
ctp
 in  event of         credit-related shocks
 the standards encompass both prescribed regulatory stress         scenarios and high-level principles governing a banks internal stress testing
 the         prescribed scenarios are not intended to capture all potential sources of stress
         rar
 ir primary focus is on valuation changes involving large
 broad-based         movements in spreads for single-name bonds and credit default swaps
 such as         could accompany major systemic financial or macroeconomic shocks
 and         associated spillovers to prices for index and bespoke tranches and or complex         correlation positions
 in addition to  prescribed scenarios
 a bank is expected         to implement a rigorous internal stress testing process to address or potential         correlation trading risks
 including bank-specific risks related to its underlying         business model and hedging strategies
      prescribed stress tests
 historical reference periods    99
2   the prescribed stress scenarios below are framed in terms of risk factor         movements affecting credit spreads over specific historical reference periods
 the         term risk factor encompasses any parameter or input within  pricing model          can vary over time
 examples include
 but are not limited to
 single-name risk
"        neutral default rates/intensities"
 recovery rates
 market-implied correlations for         index tranches
 parameters used to infer market-implied correlations for bespoke         tranches from those for index tranches
 index-single name basis risks
 and index
        tranche basis risks
    99
3   the prescribed stress tests refer to specific historical reference periods
 these         periods correspond to historical intervals of three-months or less over which         spreads for single-name and tranched credit products have exhibited very large
         broad based increases or decreases
 as described more fully in mar99
4 to         mar99
15
 for each stress test  historical reference period is used to calibrate          sizes of  assumed shocks to credit-related risk factors
 this approach to         calibrating  sizes of shocks is intended to accommodate  wide range of         pricing models observed in practice
    99

  committee may modify  historical reference periods         specified in mar99

 or specify additional reference periods
 as it deems         appropriate in light of developments in correlation trading markets
 in addition
         at ir discretion national supervisors may require banks to perform stress tests         based on additional reference periods
 or may require additional stress tests         based on methodologies different from those described herein
      prescribed stress tests
 historical stress tests    99
6   for each historical reference period
 several stress tests are to be undertaken
         each stress scenario involves replicating historical movements in all credit-related         risk factors over  reference period
 in se exercises
 only credit-related risk         factors are shocked
 for example
 non-credit-related risk factors driving default
        free term structures of interest rates and foreign exchange rates should be fixed         at current levels
    99
7   this description presumes   banks pricing model can be used to         decompose historical movements in credit spreads into changes in risk factors
 if          pricing model does not take this form explicitly
  bank will need to         translate  stress scenarios into equivalent risk factor representations  are         compatible with  structure of its pricing model
 as with all aspects of          standards set forth in this guidance
 such translations should be made in         consultation with supervisors and are subject to supervisory approval
      prescribed stress tests
 jumps to default      99
8   the preceding stress scenarios encompass changes in credit spreads
 but abstract         from defaults of individual firms
 the final set of stress tests incorporates         assumptions of actual defaults into  sector shock scenarios
 for each historical         scenario in mar99

 four jump-to-default 
jtd
 stress tests should be performed
         in  first
  bank should assume an instantaneous jtd with zero recovery of            corporate name in  current ctp having  largest jtd01 measure
 in          second stress test  bank should assume jtds with zero recovery of  two         corporate names having  largest jtd01 measures
 similarly
 in  third         
fourth
 stress test
  bank should assume jtds with zero recovery of  three

  banks methodology should reflect  current        credit quality of specific names

  shocks to risk factors        for  firm should be consistent with those for similar quality firms over         reference period

 implied ratings from credit spreads

      internal stress testing    99
16 in addition to  prescribed stress tests set forth in mar99
2 through mar99
15
        banks applying  comprehensive risk measure approach are expected to        implement a rigorous internal stress testing process for  ctp
 subject to        supervisory review
 a banks internal stress testing for  ctp should identify        stress scenarios and n assess  effects of  scenarios on  mtm value of         ctp
 the framework is intended to be flexible
 scenarios may be historical
        hypotical
 or model-based
 and may be deterministic or stochastic
 key        variables specified in a scenario may include
 for example
 default rates
 recovery        rates
 credit spreads
 and correlations
 or y might focus directly on price        changes for ctp positions
 a bank may choose to have scenarios apply to         entire correlation trading portfolio
 or it may identify scenarios specific to sub
       portfolios of  correlation trading portfolio
    99
17 the internal stress tests should be economically meaningful
 taking into account         current composition of  ctp
  banks business model for this desk
 and         nature of its hedging activities

      supervisory framework for  use of backtesting in conjunction  with  internal models approach to market risk capital requirements  99
19 this section elaborates  requirements of mar30
16 for incorporating        backtesting into  internal models approach to market risk capital        requirements
 the aim of this framework is  promotion of more rigorous        approaches to backtesting and  supervisory interpretation of backtesting        results
    99
20 many banks  have adopted an internal model-based approach to market risk        measurement routinely compare daily profits and losses with model-generated        risk measures to gauge  quality and accuracy of ir risk measurement        systems
 this process
 known as backtesting
 has been found useful by many        institutions as y have developed and introduced ir risk measurement        models
    99
21 the essence of all backtesting efforts is  comparison of actual trading results        with model-generated risk measures
 if this comparison is close enough
         backtest raises no issues regarding  quality of  risk measurement model
 in        some cases
 however
  comparison uncovers sufficient differences         problems almost certainly must exist
 eir with  model or with         assumptions of  backtest
 in between se two cases is a grey area where         test results are
 on ir own
 inconclusive
      description of  backtesting framework    99
22 the backtesting framework developed by  committee is based on         adopted by many of  banks  use internal market risk measurement        models
 these backtesting programs typically consist of a periodic comparison of         banks daily value-at-risk measures with  subsequent daily profit or loss        
trading outcome
""
 the value-at-risk measures are intended to be larger than all        but a certain fraction of  trading outcomes
 where  fraction is determined        by  confidence level of  value-at-risk measure
 comparing  risk        measures with  trading outcomes simply means   bank counts         number of times   risk measures were larger than  trading outcome
         the fraction actually covered can n be compared with  intended level of         coverage to gauge  performance of  banks risk model
 in some cases
 this         last step is relatively informal
 although re are a number of statistical tests          may also be applied
 the supervisory framework for backtesting in mar99
19 to         mar99
69 involves all of se steps
 and attempts to set out as consistent an         interpretation of each step as is feasible without imposing unnecessary burdens
    99
23 under  value-at-risk framework
  risk measure is an estimate of  amount         could be lost on a set of positions due to general market movements over a        given holding period
 measured using a specified confidence level
 the backtests        to be applied compare wher  observed percentage of outcomes covered        by  risk measure is consistent with a 99% level of confidence
 that is
 y        attempt to determine if a banks 99th percentile risk measures truly cover 99% of         firms trading outcomes
    99
24 an additional consideration in specifying  appropriate risk measures and        trading outcomes for backtesting arises because  value-at-risk approach to        risk measurement is generally based on  sensitivity of a static portfolio to        instantaneous price shocks
 that is
 end-of-day trading positions are input into         risk measurement model
 which assesses  possible change in  value of        this static portfolio due to price and rate movements over  assumed holding        period
    99
25 while this is straightforward in ory
 in practice it complicates  issue of        backtesting
 for instance
 it is often argued  value-at-risk measures cannot be        compared against actual trading outcomes
 since  actual outcomes will        inevitably be contaminated by changes in portfolio composition during         holding period
 according to this view
  inclusion of fee income toger with        trading gains and losses resulting from changes in  composition of         portfolio should not be included in  definition of  trading outcome because        y do not relate to  risk inherent in  static portfolio  was assumed in        constructing  value-at-risk measure
    99
26 this argument is persuasive with regard to  use of value-at-risk measures        based on price shocks calibrated to longer holding periods
 that is
 comparing         ten-day
 99th percentile risk measures from  internal models capital         requirement with actual ten-day trading outcomes would probably not be a         meaningful exercise
 in particular
 in any given ten day period
 significant changes         in portfolio composition relative to  initial positions are common at major         trading institutions
 for this reason
  backtesting framework described here         involves  use of risk measures calibrated to a one-day holding period
 or         than  restrictions mentioned in this paper
  test would be based on how         banks model risk internally
    99
27 given  use of one-day risk measures
 it is appropriate to employ one-day        trading outcomes as  benchmark to use in  backtesting program
 the same        concerns about contamination of  trading outcomes discussed above        continue to be relevant
 however
 even for one-day trading outcomes
 that is
        re is a concern   overall one-day trading outcome is not a suitable        point of comparison
 because it reflects  effects of intra-day trading
 possibly        including fee income  is booked in connection with  sale of new products
    99
28 on  one hand
 intra-day trading will tend to increase  volatility of trading        outcomes
 and may result in cases where  overall trading outcome exceeds         risk measure
 this event clearly does not imply a problem with  methods        used to calculate  risk measure
 rar
 it is simply outside  scope of what         value-at-risk method is intended to capture
 on  or hand
 including fee        income may similarly distort  backtest
 but in  or direction
 since fee        income often has annuity-like characteristics
    99
29 since this fee income is not typically included in  calculation of  risk        measure
 problems with  risk measurement model could be masked by        including fee income in  definition of  trading outcome used for        backtesting purposes
    99
30 some have argued   actual trading outcomes experienced by  bank are         most important and relevant figures for risk management purposes
 and          risk measures should be benchmarked against this reality
 even if         assumptions behind ir calculations are limited in this regard
 ors have also        argued   issue of fee income can be addressed sufficiently
 albeit crudely
        by simply removing  mean of  trading outcomes from ir time series        before performing  backtests
 a more sophisticated approach would involve a        detailed attribution of income by source
 including fees
 spreads
 market        movements
 and intra-day trading results
        99
31 to  extent   backtesting program is viewed purely as a statistical test of         integrity of  calculation of  value-at-risk measure
 it is clearly most        appropriate to employ a definition of daily trading outcome  allows for an           uncontaminated test
 to meet this standard
 banks should develop          capability to perform backtests based on  hypotical changes in portfolio         value  would occur were end-of-day positions to remain unchanged
    99
32 backtesting using actual daily profits and losses is also a useful exercise since it        can uncover cases where  risk measures are not accurately capturing trading        volatility in spite of being calculated with integrity
    99
33 for se reasons
  committee urges banks to develop  capability to        perform backtests using both hypotical and actual trading outcomes
        although national supervisors may differ in  emphasis  y wish to place        on se different approaches to backtesting
 it is clear  each approach has        value
 in combination
  two approaches are likely to provide a strong        understanding of  relation between calculated risk measures and trading        outcomes
    99
34 the next step in specifying  backtesting program concerns  nature of         backtest itself
 and  frequency with which it is to be performed
 the framework        adopted by  committee
 which is also  most straightforward procedure for        comparing  risk measures with  trading outcomes
 is simply to calculate         number of times   trading outcomes are not covered by  risk measures        
exceptions
""
 for example
 over 200 trading days
 a 99% daily risk measure        should cover
 on average
 198 of  200 trading outcomes
 leaving two        exceptions
    99
35 with regard to  frequency of  backtest
  desire to base  backtest on        as many observations as possible must be balanced against  desire to perform         test on a regular basis
 the backtesting framework to be applied entails a        formal testing and accounting of exceptions on a quarterly basis using  most        recent twelve months of data
    99
36 using  most recent twelve months of data yields approximately 250 daily        observations for  purposes of backtesting
 the national supervisor will use         number of exceptions 
out of 250
 generated by  banks model as  basis for        a supervisory response
 in many cases
 re will be no response
 in or cases
         supervisor may initiate a dialogue with  bank to determine if re is a        problem with a banks model
 in  most serious cases
  supervisor may        impose an increase in a banks capital requirement or disallow use of  model
        99
37 the appeal of using  number of exceptions as  primary reference point in         backtesting process is  simplicity and straightforwardness of this        approach
 from a statistical point of view
 using  number of exceptions as          basis for appraising a banks model requires relatively few strong assumptions
 in         particular
  primary assumption is  each days test 
"exception/no         exception"
 is independent of  outcome of any of  ors
    99
38 the committee of course recognises  tests of this type are limited in ir        power to distinguish an accurate model from an inaccurate model
 to a        statistician
 this means  it is not possible to calibrate  test so  it        correctly signals all  problematic models without giving false signals of trouble        at many ors
 this limitation has been a prominent consideration in  design        of  framework presented here
 and should also be prominent among         considerations of national supervisors in interpreting  results of a banks        backtesting program
 however
  committee does not view this limitation as a        decisive objection to  use of backtesting
 rar
 conditioning supervisory        standards on a clear framework
 though limited and imperfect
 is seen as        preferable to a purely judgmental standard or one with no incentive features        whatsoever
      supervisory framework for  interpretation of backtesting results    99
39 it is with  statistical limitations of backtesting in mind   committee is        introducing a framework for  supervisory interpretation of backtesting results         encompasses a range of possible responses
 depending on  strength of         signal generated from  backtest
 these responses are classified into three        zones
 distinguished by colours into a hierarchy of responses
 the green zone        corresponds to backtesting results  do not mselves suggest a problem        with  quality or accuracy of a banks model
 the yellow zone encompasses        results  do raise questions in this regard
 but where such a conclusion is not        definitive
 the red zone indicates a backtesting result  almost certainly        indicates a problem with a banks risk model
    99
40 these zones are defined in respect of  number of exceptions generated in         backtesting program as set forth in mar99
41 to mar99
69
 to place se        definitions in proper perspective
 however
 it is useful to examine         probabilities of obtaining various numbers of exceptions under different        assumptions about  accuracy of a banks risk measurement model
    99
41 three zones have been delineated and ir boundaries chosen in order to        balance two types of statistical error
               
1
  possibility  an accurate risk model would be classified as inaccurate             on  basis of its backtesting result
 and           
2
  possibility  an inaccurate model would not be classified  way             based on its backtesting result
    99
42 table 1 in mar99
45 reports  probabilities of obtaining a particular number of        exceptions from a sample of 250 independent observations under several        assumptions about  actual percentage of outcomes   model captures        
 is
 se are binomial probabilities
""
 for example
  left-hand portion of        table 1 reports probabilities associated with an accurate model 
 is
 a true        coverage level of 99%
""
 under se assumptions
  column labelled exact        reports  exactly five exceptions can be expected in 6
7% of  samples
 the        right-hand portion of table 1 reports probabilities associated with several        possible inaccurate models
 namely models whose true levels of coverage are        98%
 97%
 96%
 and 95%
 respectively
 thus
  column labelled exact under an        assumed coverage level of 97% shows  five exceptions would n be        expected in 10
9% of  samples
    99
43 table 1 also reports several important error probabilities
 for  assumption          model covers 99% of outcomes 
 desired level of coverage
""
  table        reports  probability  selecting a given number of exceptions as a threshold        for rejecting  accuracy of  model will result in an erroneous rejection of an        accurate model 
type 1 error
""
 for example
 if  threshold is set as low as one        exception
 n accurate models will be rejected fully 91
9% of  time
 because        y will escape rejection only in  8
1% of cases where y generate zero        exceptions
 as  threshold number of exceptions is increased
  probability of        making this type of error declines
    99
44 under  assumptions   models true level of coverage is not 99%
 table        1 reports  probability  selecting a given number of exceptions as a        threshold for rejecting  accuracy of  model will result in an erroneous        acceptance of a model with  assumed 
inaccurate
 level of coverage 
type 2        error
""
 for example
 if  models actual level of coverage is 97%
 and         threshold for rejection is set at seven or more exceptions
  table indicates         this model would be erroneously accepted 37
5% of  time
        99
45 in interpreting  information in table 1
 it is also important to understand         although  alternative models appear close to  desired standard in        probability terms 
97% is close to 99%
""
  difference between se models in        terms of  size of  risk measures generated can be substantial
 that is
 a        bank  risk measure could be substantially less than  of an accurate model        and still cover 97% of  trading outcomes
 for example
 in  case of normally        distributed trading outcomes
  97th percentile corresponds to 1
88 standard        deviations
 while  99th percentile corresponds to 2
33 standard deviations
 an           increase of nearly 25%
 thus
  supervisory desire to distinguish between         models providing 99% coverage
 and those providing say
 97% coverage
 is a very         real one
             probabilities of exceptions                                                                                      table 1                                 model is accurate           model is inaccurate
 possible alternative levels of  coverage          exceptions 
out                             coverage = 99%      coverage = 98%     coverage = 97%        coverage = 96%        coverage = 95%            of 250

 as well as type 1  or type 2 error probabilities       derived from se exact probabilities as set out in mar99
41 to mar99
45
      99
46 the results in table 1 also demonstrate some of  statistical limitations of        backtesting
 in particular
 re is no threshold number of exceptions  yields        both a low probability of erroneously rejecting an accurate model and a low        probability of erroneously accepting all of  relevant inaccurate models
 it is for        this reason   committee has rejected an approach  contains only a        single threshold
    99
47 given se limitations
  committee has classified outcomes into three        categories
 in  first category
  test results are consistent with an accurate        model
 and  possibility of erroneously accepting an inaccurate model is low        
green zone
""
 at  or extreme
  test results are extremely unlikely to have        resulted from an accurate model
 and  probability of erroneously rejecting an        accurate model on this basis is remote 
red zone
""
 in between se two cases
        however
 is a zone where  backtesting results could be consistent with eir        accurate or inaccurate models
 and  supervisor should encourage a bank to        present additional information about its model before taking action 
yellow zone
""
    99
48 table 2 below sets out  committees agreed boundaries for se zones and         presumptive supervisory response for each backtesting outcome
 based on a        sample of 250 observations
 for or sample sizes
  boundaries should be        deduced by calculating  binomial probabilities associated with true coverage        of 99%
 as in table 1
 the yellow zone begins at  point such          cumulative probabilities
  is  probability of obtaining  number or fewer        exceptions
 equals or exceeds 95%
 table 2 reports se cumulative probabilities        for each number of exceptions
 for 250 observations
 it can be seen  five or        fewer exceptions will be obtained 95
88% of  time when  true level of        coverage is 99%
 thus
  yellow zone begins at five exceptions
    99
49 similarly
  beginning of  red zone is defined as  point such          probability of obtaining  number or fewer exceptions equals or exceeds        99

 the boundaries shown in  table are based on a sample of 250       observations
 for or sample sizes
  yellow zone begins at  point where        cumulative probability equals or exceeds 95%
 and  red zone begins at  point where        cumulative probability equals or exceeds 99
99% as set out in mar99
48 and mar99
49
         plus to  multiplication factor ranges from zero to one based on  outcome of        backtesting as set out in mar30
16 and mar99
51 to mar99
65
         note  se cumulative probabilities and  type 1 error probabilities reported in       table 1 do not sum to one because  cumulative probability for a given number of       exceptions includes  possibility of obtaining exactly  number of exceptions
 as does        type 1 error probability
 thus
  sum of se two probabilities exceeds one by        amount of  probability of obtaining exactly  number of exceptions
        99
50 the green zone needs little explanation
 since a model  truly provides 99%        coverage would be quite likely to produce as many as four exceptions in a sample        of 250 outcomes
 re is little reason for concern raised by backtesting results         fall in this range
 this is reinforced by  results in table 1
 which indicate          accepting outcomes in this range leads to only a small chance of erroneously         accepting an inaccurate model
    99
51 the range from five to nine exceptions constitutes  yellow zone
 outcomes in        this range are plausible for both accurate and inaccurate models
 although table        1 suggests  y are generally more likely for inaccurate models than for        accurate models
 moreover
  results in table 1 indicate   presumption          model is inaccurate should grow as  number of exceptions increases        in  range from five to nine
    99
52 within  yellow zone
  number of exceptions should generally guide  size        of potential supervisory increases in a firms capital requirement
 table 2 sets out         guidelines for  value of  plus factor in  multiplication factors        applicable to  internal models capital requirement as set out in mar30
16
        resulting from backtesting results in  yellow zone
 these guidelines help in        maintaining  appropriate structure of incentives applicable to  internal        models approach
 in particular
  potential supervisory penalty increases with         number of exceptions
 the results in table 1 generally support  notion         nine exceptions is a more troubling result than five exceptions
 and se steps        are meant to reflect 
    99
53 these particular values reflect  general idea   increase in         multiplication factor should be sufficient to return  model to a 99th percentile        standard
 for example
 five exceptions in a sample of 250 implies only 98%        coverage
 thus
  increase in  multiplication factor should be sufficient to        transform a model with 98% coverage into one with 99% coverage
 needless to        say
 precise calculations of this sort require additional statistical assumptions         are not likely to hold in all cases
 for example
 if  distribution of trading        outcomes is assumed to be normal
 n  ratio of  99th percentile to         98th percentile is approximately 1
14
 and  increase needed in         multiplication factor is refore approximately 0
40 for a scaling factor of 3
 if         actual distribution is not normal
 but instead has fat tails
 n larger increases        may be required to reach  99th percentile standard
 the concern about fat        tails was also an important factor in  choice of  specific increments set out        in table 2
        99
54 it is important to stress
 however
  se increases are not meant to be purely        automatic
 the results in table 1 indicate  results in  yellow zone do not        always imply an inaccurate model
 and  committee has no interest in        penalising banks solely for bad luck
 neverless
 to keep  incentives aligned        properly
 backtesting results in  yellow zone should generally be presumed to         imply an increase in  multiplication factor unless  bank can demonstrate          such an increase is not warranted

  burden of proof in se situations should not be on         supervisor to prove  a problem exists
 but rar should be on  bank to        prove  ir model is fundamentally sound
 in such a situation
 re are        many different types of additional information  might be relevant to an        assessment of  banks model
    99
56 for example
 it would n be particularly valuable to see  results of backtests        covering disaggregated subsets of  banks overall trading activities
 many        banks  engage in regular backtesting programs break up ir overall trading        portfolio into trading units organised around risk factors or product categories
        disaggregating in this fashion could allow  tracking of a problem  surfaced        at  aggregate level back to its source at  level of a specific trading unit or        risk model
    99
57 banks should also document all of  exceptions generated from ir ongoing        backtesting program
 including an explanation for  exception
 this        documentation is important to determining an appropriate supervisory response        to a backtesting result in  yellow zone
 banks may also implement backtesting        for confidence intervals or than  99th percentile
 or may perform or        statistical tests not considered here
 naturally
 this information could also prove        very helpful in assessing ir model
    99
58 in practice
 re are several possible explanations for a backtesting exception
        some of which go to  basic integrity of  model
 some of which suggest an        under-specified or low-quality model
 and some of which suggest eir bad luck        or poor intra-day trading results
 classifying  exceptions generated by a banks        model into se categories can be a very useful exercise
           
1
 basic integrity of  model
               
a
 the banks systems simply are not capturing  risk of  positions                 mselves 
eg  positions of an overseas office are being reported                 incorrectly
""
               
b
" model volatilities and/or correlations were calculated incorrectly "
eg                  computer is dividing by 250 when it should be dividing by 225
""
             
2
 models accuracy could be improved
               the risk measurement model is not assessing  risk of some instruments             with sufficient precision 
eg too few maturity buckets or an omitted spread
""
           
3
 bad luck or markets moved in fashion unanticipated by  model
               
a
 random chance 
a very low probability event
""
               
b
 markets moved by more than  model predicted was likely 
i
e
                 volatility was significantly higher than expected
""
               
c
   markets did not move toger as expected 
i
e
 correlations were                   significantly different than what was assumed by  model
""
           
4
 intraday trading
 there was a large 
and money-losing
 change in  banks             positions or some or income event between  end of  first day             
when  risk estimate was calculated
 and  end of  second day 
when             trading results were tabulated
""
    99
59 in general
 problems relating to  basic integrity of  risk measurement        model are potentially  most serious
 if re are exceptions attributed to this        category for a particular trading unit
  plus should apply
 in addition
"         model may be in need of substantial review and/or adjustment"
 and         supervisor would be expected to take appropriate action to ensure  this        occurs
    99
60 the second category of problem 
lack of model precision
 is one  can be        expected to occur at least part of  time with most risk measurement models
        no model can hope to achieve infinite precision
 and thus all models involve        some amount of approximation
 if
 however
 a particular banks model appears        more prone to this type of problem than ors
  supervisor should impose         plus factor and also consider what or incentives are needed to spur        improvements
    99
61 the third category of problems 
markets moved in a fashion unanticipated by         model
 should also be expected to occur at least some of  time with value-at
       risk models
 in particular
 even an accurate model is not expected to cover 100%        of trading outcomes
 some exceptions are surely  random 1%   model        can be expected not to cover
 in or cases
  behaviour of  markets may        shift so  previous estimates of volatility and correlation are less appropriate
        no value-at-risk model will be immune from this type of problem
 it is inherent in         reliance on past market behaviour as a means of gauging  risk of future        market movements
      99
62 finally
 depending on  definition of trading outcomes employed for         purpose of backtesting
 exceptions could also be generated by intra-day trading        results or an unusual event in trading income or than from positioning
        although exceptions for se reasons would not necessarily suggest a problem        with  banks value-at-risk model
 y could still be cause for supervisory        concern and  imposition of  plus should be considered
    99
63 the extent to which a trading outcome exceeds  risk measure is anor        relevant piece of information
 all else equal
 exceptions generated by trading        outcomes far in excess of  risk measure are a matter of greater concern than        are outcomes only slightly larger than  risk measure
    99
64 in deciding wher or not to apply increases in a banks capital requirement
 it is        envisioned   supervisor could weigh se factors as well as ors
        including an appraisal of  banks compliance with applicable qualitative        standards of risk management
 based on  additional information provided by         bank
  supervisor will decide on  appropriate course of action
    99
65 in general
  imposition of a higher capital requirement for outcomes in         yellow zone is an appropriate response when  supervisor believes  reason        for being in  yellow zone is a correctable problem in a banks model
 this can        be contrasted with  case of an unexpected bout of high market volatility
        which nearly all models may fail to predict
 while se episodes may be stressful
        y do not necessarily indicate  a banks risk model is in need of redesign
        finally
 in  case of severe problems with  basic integrity of  model
         supervisor should consider wher to disallow  use of  model for capital        purposes altoger
    99
66 finally
 in contrast to  yellow zone where  supervisor may exercise        judgement in interpreting  backtesting results
 outcomes in  red zone 
ten        or more exceptions
 should generally lead to an automatic presumption  a        problem exists with a banks model
 this is because it is extremely unlikely  an        accurate model would independently generate ten or more exceptions from a        sample of 250 trading outcomes
    99
67 in general
 refore
 if a banks model falls into  red zone
  supervisor        should automatically increase  multiplication factor applicable to a firms        model by one 
from three to four
""
 needless to say
  supervisor should also        begin investigating  reasons why  banks model produced such a large        number of misses
 and should require  bank to begin work on improving its        model immediately
        99
68 although ten exceptions is a very high number for 250 observations
 re will on        very rare occasions be a valid reason why an accurate model will produce so        many exceptions
 in particular
 when financial markets are subjected to a major        regime shift
 many volatilities and correlations can be expected to shift as well
        perhaps substantially
 unless a bank is prepared to update its volatility and        correlation estimates instantaneously
 such a regime shift could generate a        number of exceptions in a short period of time
 in essence
 however
 se        exceptions would all be occurring for  same reason
 and refore         appropriate supervisory reaction might not be  same as if re were ten        exceptions
 but each from a separate incident
 for example
 one possible        supervisory response in this instance would be to simply require  banks        model to take account of  regime shift as quickly as it can while maintaining         integrity of its procedures for updating  model
    99
69 it should be stressed
 however
   committee believes  this exception        should be allowed only under  most extraordinary circumstances
 and  it is        committed to an automatic and non-discretionary increase in a banks capital        requirement for backtesting results  fall into  red zone

                                           ope10                                   definitions and application                                   this chapter defines operational risk and                                   introduces  methodologies available for                                   calculating operational risk capital requirements
                                    introduction  10
1   operational risk is defined as  risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed         internal processes
 people and systems or from external events
 this definition         includes legal risk
 but excludes strategic and reputational risk
       legal risk includes
 but is not limited to
 exposure to fines
 penalties
 or                     punitive damages resulting from supervisory actions
 as well as private                     settlements
      10
2   the framework outlined in this standard presents three methods for calculating         operational risk capital requirements in a continuum of increasing sophistication         and risk sensitivity
           
1
  basic indicator approach
           
2
  standardised approach
 and           
3
 advanced measurement approaches 
amas
""
    10
3   banks are encouraged to move along  spectrum of available approaches as         y develop more sophisticated operational risk measurement systems and         practices
 qualifying criteria for  standardised approach and ama are         presented below
    10
4   internationally active banks and banks with significant operational risk exposures         
for example
 specialised processing banks
 are expected to use an approach          is more sophisticated than  basic indicator approach and  is appropriate         for  risk profile of  institution
 a bank will be permitted to use  basic         indicator or standardised approach for some parts of its operations and an ama         for ors provided certain minimum criteria are met
 see ope10
6 to ope10
9
     supervisors will review  capital requirement produced by                      operational risk approach used by a bank 
wher basic indicator                     approach
 standardised approach or ama
 for general credibility
                     especially in relation to a firms peers
 in  event  credibility is                     lacking
 appropriate supervisory action under pillar 2 will be considered
      10
5         a bank will not be allowed to choose to revert to a simpler approach once it has         been approved for a more advanced approach without supervisory approval
         however
 if a supervisor determines  a bank using a more advanced approach         no longer meets  qualifying criteria for this approach
 it may require  bank         to revert to a simpler approach for some or all of its operations
 until it meets          conditions specified by  supervisor for returning to a more advanced approach
      partial use  10
6   a bank will be permitted to use an ama for some parts of its operations and          basic indicator approach or standardised approach for  balance 
partial use
""
         provided   following conditions are met
           
1
 all operational risks of  banks global
 consolidated operations are             captured
           
2
 all of  banks operations  are covered by  ama meet              qualitative criteria for using an ama
 while those parts of its operations              are using one of  simpler approaches meet  qualifying criteria for              approach
           
3
 on  date of implementation of an ama
 a significant part of  banks             operational risks are captured by  ama
 and           
4
 the bank provides its supervisor with a plan specifying  timetable to             which it intends to roll out  ama across all but an immaterial part of its             operations
 the plan should be driven by  practicality and feasibility of             moving to  ama over time
 and not for or reasons
    10
7   subject to  approval of its supervisor
 a bank opting for partial use may         determine which parts of its operations will use an ama on  basis of business         line
 legal structure
 geography
 or or internally determined basis

  bank may

 consolidated operational risk capital requirements              results of an ama calculation at a subsidiary where  ama has been             approved by  relevant host supervisor and is acceptable to  banks             home supervisor
      10
9   approvals of  nature described in ope10
8 should be granted only on an         exceptional basis
 such exceptional approvals should generally be limited to         circumstances where a bank is prevented from meeting se conditions due to         implementation decisions of supervisors of  banks subsidiary operations in         foreign jurisdictions
                   ope20                                   basic indicator approach                                   this chapter describes  basic indicator                                   approach for calculating operational risk capital                                   requirements

1   banks using  basic indicator approach must hold capital for operational risk         equal to  average over  previous three years of a fixed percentage         
denoted alpha
 of positive annual gross income
 figures for any year in which         annual gross income is negative or zero should be excluded from both          numerator and denominator when calculating  average
       if negative gross income distorts a banks pillar 1 capital charge
                     supervisors will consider appropriate supervisory action under pillar 2

                                   based on a division of a bank  activities into                                   eight business lines

1   in  standardised approach
 banks activities are divided into eight business         lines
 corporate finance
 trading and sales
 retail banking
 commercial banking
         payment and settlement
 agency services
 asset management
 and retail         brokerage
 the business lines are defined in detail in ope25
16 to ope25
25
    25
2   within each business line
 gross income is a broad indicator  serves as a proxy         for  scale of business operations and thus  likely scale of operational risk         exposure within each of se business lines
 the capital requirement for each         business line is calculated by multiplying gross income by a factor 
denoted beta
         assigned to  business line
 beta serves as a proxy for  industry-wide         relationship between  operational risk loss experience for a given business line         and  aggregate level of gross income for  business line
 it should be noted          in  standardised approach gross income is measured for each business         line
 not  whole institution
 i
e
 in corporate finance
  indicator is  gross         income generated in  corporate finance business line
    25
3   the total capital requirement is calculated as  three-year average of  simple         summation of  regulatory capital requirements across each of  business         lines in each year
 in any given year
 negative capital requirements 
resulting from         negative gross income
 in any business line may offset positive capital         requirements in or business lines without limit
 however
 where          aggregate capital requirement across all business lines within a given year is         negative
 n  input to  numerator for  year will be zero
     at national discretion
 supervisors may adopt a more conservative                     treatment of negative gross income
    as under  basic indicator approach
 if negative gross income                     distorts a banks pillar 1 capital requirement under  standardised                     approach
 supervisors will consider appropriate supervisory action                     under pillar 2
      25
4   the total capital requirement under  standardised approach
 ktsa
 may be         expressed as follows
 where gi1-8 = annual gross income in a given year
 as         defined in  basic indicator approach
 for each of  eight business lines and  a fixed  percentage
 set by  committee

5   in order to qualify for use of  standardised approach
 a bank must satisfy its         supervisor 
 at a minimum
           
1
 its board of directors and senior management
 as appropriate
 are actively             involved in  oversight of  operational risk management framework
           
2
 it has an operational risk management system  is conceptually sound             and is implemented with integrity
 and           
3
 it has sufficient resources in  use of  approach in  major business             lines as well as  control and audit areas
    25
6   supervisors will have  right to insist on a period of initial monitoring of a bank         s standardised approach before it is used for regulatory capital purposes
        25
7   a bank must develop specific policies and have documented criteria for mapping         gross income for current business lines and activities into  standardised         framework
 the criteria must be reviewed and adjusted for new or changing           business activities as appropriate
 the principles for business line mapping are set         out in ope25
16 to ope25

         it is important  such banks have adequate operational risk management         systems
 consequently
 an internationally active bank using  standardised         approach must meet  following additional criteria
           
1
 the bank must have an operational risk management system with clear             responsibilities assigned to an operational risk management function
 the             operational risk management function is responsible for developing             strategies to identify
 assess
" monitor and control/mitigate operational risk"
             for codifying firm-level policies and procedures concerning operational risk             management and controls
 for  design and implementation of  firms             operational risk assessment methodology
 and for  design and             implementation of a risk-reporting system for operational risk
           
2
 as part of  banks internal operational risk assessment system
  bank             must systematically track relevant operational risk data including material             losses by business line
 its operational risk assessment system must be             closely integrated into  risk management processes of  bank
 its             output must be an integral part of  process of monitoring and controlling              banks operational risk profile
 for instance
 this information must play a             prominent role in risk reporting
 management reporting
 and risk analysis
             the bank must have techniques for creating incentives to improve              management of operational risk throughout  firm
           
3
 there must be regular reporting of operational risk exposures
 including             material operational losses
 to business unit management
 senior             management
 and to  board of directors
 the bank must have procedures             for taking appropriate action according to  information within              management reports
           
4
 the banks operational risk management system must be well documented
             the bank must have a routine in place for ensuring compliance with a             documented set of internal policies
 controls and procedures concerning              operational risk management system
 which must include policies for              treatment of non-compliance issues
           
5
 the banks operational risk management processes and assessment system             must be subject to validation and regular independent review
 these reviews             must include both  activities of  business units and of  operational             risk management function
           
6
 the banks operational risk assessment system 
including  internal             validation processes
" must be subject to regular independent review by             internal or external auditors and/or supervisors"
        for or banks
 se criteria are recommended
 with national                     discretion to impose m as requirements
        the alternative standardised approach  25
9   at national supervisory discretion a supervisor can choose to allow a bank to use          alternative standardised approach 
asa
 provided  bank is able to satisfy         its supervisor  this alternative approach provides an improved basis by
 for         example
 avoiding double counting of risks
 once a bank has been allowed to use          asa
 it will not be allowed to revert to use of  standardised approach         without  permission of its supervisor
 it is not envisaged  large diversified         banks in major markets would use  asa
    25
10 supervisors allowing banks to use  asa must decide on  appropriate        qualifying criteria for  approach
 as  criteria set forth in ope25
7 and        ope25
8 may not be appropriate
    25
11 under  asa
"  operational risk capital requirement/methodology is  same        as for  standardised approach except for two business lines  retail banking        and commercial banking"
 for se business lines
 loans and advances         multiplied by a fixed factor m  replaces gross income as  exposure        indicator
 the betas for retail and commercial banking are unchanged from         standardised approach
          25
12 the asa operational risk capital requirement
 krb
 for retail banking 
with          same basic formula for commercial banking
 can be expressed as follows
 where          rb            is  beta for  retail banking business line
 larb is total outstanding retail         loans and advances 
non-risk weighted and gross of provisions
""
 averaged over          past three years
 and m is 0
035
          25
13 for  purposes of  asa
 total loans and advances in  retail banking        business line consists of  total drawn amounts in  following credit        portfolios
 retail
 small or medium-sized entities 
smes
 treated as retail
 and        purchased retail receivables
 for commercial banking
 total loans and advances        consists of  drawn amounts in  following credit portfolios
 corporate
        sovereign
 bank
 specialised lending
 smes treated as corporate and purchased        corporate receivables
 the book value of securities held in  banking book        should also be included
    25
14 under  asa
 banks may aggregate retail and commercial banking 
if y wish        to
 using a beta of 15%
 similarly
 those banks  are unable to disaggregate        ir gross income into  or six business lines can aggregate  total gross        income for se six business lines using a beta of 18%
 with negative gross        income treated as described in ope25
3 and ope25
4
    25
15 as under  standardised approach
  total capital requirement for  asa is        calculated as  simple summation of  regulatory capital requirements across        each of  eight business lines
      business lines  25
16 all activities must be mapped into  eight level 1 business lines in table 2 in a        mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive manner
"             mapping of business lines                                                            table 2               level 1               level 2                        activity groups         corporate finance  corporate finance municipal / government finance  merchant banking  advisory services          mergers and acquisitions"

      25
17 any banking or non-banking activity which cannot be readily mapped into         business line framework
 but which represents an ancillary function to an activity        included in  framework
 must be allocated to  business line it supports
 if        more than one business line is supported through  ancillary activity
 an        objective mapping criteria must be used
    25
18 when mapping gross income
 if an activity cannot be mapped into a particular        business line n  business line yielding  highest requirement must be        used
 the same business line equally applies to any associated ancillary activity
    25
19 banks may use internal pricing methods to allocate gross income between        business lines provided  total gross income for  bank 
as would be        recorded under  basic indicator approach
 still equals  sum of gross        income for  eight business lines
    25
20 the mapping of activities into business lines for operational risk capital purposes        must be consistent with  definitions of business lines used for regulatory        capital calculations in or risk categories
 ie credit and market risk
 any        deviations from this principle must be clearly motivated and documented
    25
21 the mapping process used must be clearly documented
 in particular
 written        business line definitions must be clear and detailed enough to allow third parties        to replicate  business line mapping
 documentation must
 among or        things
 clearly motivate any exceptions or overrides and be kept on record
    25
22 processes must be in place to define  mapping of any new activities or        products
    25
23 senior management is responsible for  mapping policy 
which is subject to         approval by  board of directors
""
    25
24 the mapping process to business lines must be subject to independent review
        25
25 there are a variety of valid approaches  banks can use to map ir activities        to  eight business lines
 provided  approach used meets  business line        mapping principles
 neverless
  committee is aware  some banks        would welcome furr guidance
 the following is refore an example of one        possible approach  could be used by a bank to map its gross income
           
1
 gross income for retail banking consists of net interest income on loans and             advances to retail customers and smes treated as retail
 plus fees related to             traditional retail activities
 net income from swaps and derivatives held to             hedge  retail banking book
 and income on purchased retail receivables
             to calculate net interest income for retail banking
 a bank takes  interest             earned on its loans and advances to retail customers less  weighted             average cost of funding of  loans 
from whatever source retail or or             deposits
""
           
2
 similarly
 gross income for commercial banking consists of  net interest             income on loans and advances to corporate 
plus smes treated as             corporate
""
 interbank and sovereign customers and income on purchased             corporate receivables
 plus fees related to traditional commercial banking             activities including commitments
 guarantees
 bills of exchange
 net income             
eg from coupons and dividends
 on securities held in  banking book
" and             profits/losses on swaps and derivatives held to hedge  commercial             banking book"
 again
  calculation of net interest income is based on             interest earned on loans and advances to corporate
 interbank and sovereign             customers less  weighted average cost of funding for se loans 
from             whatever source
""
           
3
 for trading and sales
" gross income consists of profits/losses on instruments             held for trading purposes "
ie in  mark-to-market book
""
 net of funding             cost
 plus fees from wholesale broking
           
4
 for  or five business lines
" gross income consists primarily of  net             fees/commissions earned in each of se businesses"
" payment and             settlement consists of fees to cover provision of payment/settlement             facilities for wholesale counterparties"

    30
2   a bank adopting  ama may
 with  approval of its host supervisors and          support of its home supervisor
 use an allocation mechanism for  purpose of         determining  regulatory capital requirement for internationally active banking         subsidiaries  are not deemed to be significant relative to  overall banking         group but are mselves subject to this framework in accordance with sco10
         supervisory approval would be conditional on  bank demonstrating to          satisfaction of  relevant supervisors   allocation mechanism for se         subsidiaries is appropriate and can be supported empirically
 the board of         directors and senior management of each subsidiary are responsible for         conducting ir own assessment of  subsidiarys operational risks and         controls and ensuring  subsidiary is adequately capitalised in respect of those         risks

  incorporation of         a well-reasoned estimate of diversification benefits may be factored in at          group-wide level or at  banking subsidiary level

4   the appropriateness of  allocation methodology will be reviewed with         consideration given to  stage of development of risk-sensitive allocation         techniques and  extent to which it reflects  level of operational risk in          legal entities and across  banking group
 supervisors expect  ama         banking groups will continue efforts to develop increasingly risk-sensitive         operational risk allocation techniques
 notwithstanding initial approval of         techniques based on gross income or or proxies for operational risk
    30
5   banks adopting  ama will be required to calculate ir capital requirement         using this approach as well as  1988 accord as outlined in rbc20
14
      general standards for using  ama  30
6   in order to qualify for use of  ama a bank must satisfy its supervisor 
 at a         minimum
           
1
 its board of directors and senior management
 as appropriate
 are actively             involved in  oversight of  operational risk management framework
           
2
 it has an operational risk management system  is conceptually sound             and is implemented with integrity
 and           
3
 it has sufficient resources in  use of  approach in  major business             lines as well as  control and audit areas
    30
7   a banks ama will be subject to a period of initial monitoring by its supervisor         before it can be used for regulatory purposes
 this period will allow          supervisor to determine wher  approach is credible and appropriate
 as         discussed below
 a banks internal measurement system must reasonably         estimate unexpected losses based on  combined use of internal and relevant         external loss data
 scenario analysis and bank-specific business environment and         internal control factors
 the banks measurement system must also be capable of         supporting an allocation of economic capital for operational risk across business         lines in a manner  creates incentives to improve business line operational risk         management
      qualitative standards for using  ama  30
8   a bank must meet  following qualitative standards before it is permitted to         use an ama for operational risk capital
           
1
 the bank must have an independent operational risk management function              is responsible for  design and implementation of  banks             operational risk management framework
 the operational risk management             function is responsible for codifying firm-level policies and procedures             concerning operational risk management and controls
 for  design and             implementation of  firms operational risk measurement methodology
 for              design and implementation of a risk-reporting system for operational             risk
 and for developing strategies to identify
 measure
" monitor and control             /mitigate operational risk"
           
2
 the banks internal operational risk measurement system must be closely           integrated into  day-to-day risk management processes of  bank
 its           output must be an integral part of  process of monitoring and controlling              banks operational risk profile
 for instance
 this information must play a           prominent role in risk reporting
 management reporting
 internal capital           allocation
 and risk analysis
 the bank must have techniques for allocating           operational risk capital to major business lines and for creating incentives to           improve  management of operational risk throughout  firm
         
3
 there must be regular reporting of operational risk exposures and loss           experience to business unit management
 senior management
 and to            board of directors
 the bank must have procedures for taking appropriate           action according to  information within  management reports
         
4
 the banks operational risk management system must be well documented
           the bank must have a routine in place for ensuring compliance with a           documented set of internal policies
 controls and procedures concerning            operational risk management system
 which must include policies for            treatment of non-compliance issues
         
5
" internal and/or external auditors must perform regular reviews of            operational risk management processes and measurement systems"
 this           review must include both  activities of  business units and of            independent operational risk management function
         
6
" the validation of  operational risk measurement system by external           auditors and/or supervisory authorities must include  following"
             
a
 verifying   internal validation processes are operating in a               satisfactory manner
 and             
b
 making sure  data flows and processes associated with  risk               measurement system are transparent and accessible
 in particular
 it is               necessary  auditors and supervisory authorities are in a position to               have easy access
 whenever y judge it necessary and under               appropriate procedures
 to  systems specifications and parameters
      quantitative standards for using  ama  30
9   given  continuing evolution of analytical approaches for operational risk
          committee is not specifying  approach or distributional assumptions used to         generate  operational risk measure for regulatory capital purposes
 however
 a         bank must be able to demonstrate  its approach captures potentially severe         tail loss events
 whatever approach is used
 a bank must demonstrate  its         operational risk measure meets a soundness standard comparable to  of          internal ratings-based approach for credit risk 
ie comparable to a one year         holding period and a 99
9th percentile confidence interval
""
    30
10 in  development of operational risk measurement and management systems
        banks must have and maintain rigorous procedures for operational risk model        development and independent model validation
    30
11 the following quantitative standards apply to internally generated operational        risk measures for purposes of calculating  regulatory minimum capital        requirements
           
1
 any internal operational risk measurement system must be consistent with              scope of operational risk defined in ope10
1 and  loss event types             defined in table 1
           
2
 supervisors will require  bank to calculate its regulatory capital             requirement as  sum of expected loss 
el
 and unexpected loss 
ul
""
             unless  bank can demonstrate  it is adequately capturing el in its             internal business practices
 that is
 to base  minimum regulatory capital             requirement on ul alone
  bank must be able to demonstrate to              satisfaction of its national supervisor  it has measured and accounted for             its el exposure
           
3
 a banks risk measurement system must be sufficiently granular to capture              major drivers of operational risk affecting  shape of  tail of  loss             estimates
         
4
 risk measures for different operational risk estimates must be added for           purposes of calculating  regulatory minimum capital requirement
           however
  bank may be permitted to use internally determined           correlations in operational risk losses across individual operational risk           estimates
 provided it can demonstrate to  satisfaction of  national           supervisor  its systems for determining correlations are sound
           implemented with integrity
 and take into account  uncertainty           surrounding any such correlation estimates 
particularly in periods of stress
""
           the bank must validate its correlation assumptions using appropriate           quantitative and qualitative techniques
         
5
 any operational risk measurement system must have certain key features to           meet  supervisory soundness standard set out in this section
 these           elements must include  use of internal data
 relevant external data
           scenario analysis and factors reflecting  business environment and           internal control systems
                 
6
 a bank needs to have a credible
 transparent
 well-documented and           verifiable approach for weighting se fundamental elements in its overall           operational risk measurement system
 for example
 re may be cases           where estimates of  99
9th percentile confidence interval based primarily           on internal and external loss event data would be unreliable for business           lines with a heavy-tailed loss distribution and a small number of observed           losses
 in such cases
 scenario analysis
 and business environment and           control factors
 may play a more dominant role in  risk measurement           system
 conversely
 operational loss event data may play a more dominant           role in  risk measurement system for business lines where estimates of            99
9th percentile confidence interval based primarily on such data are           deemed reliable
 in all cases
  banks approach for weighting  four           fundamental elements should be internally consistent and avoid  double           counting of qualitative assessments or risk mitigants already recognised in           or elements of  framework

12 banks must track internal loss data according to  criteria set out in ope30
12        to ope30
15
 the tracking of internal loss event data is an essential prerequisite           to  development and functioning of a credible operational risk measurement         system
 internal loss data is crucial for tying a banks risk estimates to its actual         loss experience
 this can be achieved in a number of ways
 including using         internal loss data as  foundation of empirical risk estimates
 as a means of         validating  inputs and outputs of  banks risk measurement system
 or as          link between loss experience and risk management and control decisions
    30
13 internal loss data is most relevant when it is clearly linked to a banks current        business activities
 technological processes and risk management procedures
        therefore
 a bank must have documented procedures for assessing  on-going        relevance of historical loss data
 including those situations in which judgement        overrides
 scaling
 or or adjustments may be used
 to what extent y may be        used and who is authorised to make such decisions
    30
14 internally generated operational risk measures used for regulatory capital        purposes must be based on a minimum five-year observation period of internal        loss data
 wher  internal loss data is used directly to build  loss measure        or to validate it
 when  bank first moves to  ama
 a three-year historical        data window is acceptable 
this includes  parallel calculations in rbc20
14
""
    30
15 to qualify for regulatory capital purposes
 a banks internal loss collection        processes must meet  following standards
           
1
 to assist in supervisory validation
 a bank must be able to map its historical             internal loss data into  relevant level 1 supervisory categories defined in             ope25
16 to ope25
25 and ope30
11 and to provide se data to             supervisors upon request
 it must have documented
 objective criteria for             allocating losses to  specified business lines and event types
 however
 it             is left to  bank to decide  extent to which it applies se             categorisations in its internal operational risk measurement system
           
2
 a banks internal loss data must be comprehensive in  it captures all             material activities and exposures from all appropriate sub-systems and             geographic locations
 a bank must be able to justify  any excluded             activities or exposures
 both individually and in combination
 would not have             a material impact on  overall risk estimates
 a bank must have an             appropriate de minimis gross loss threshold for internal loss data collection
             for example 10
000
 the appropriate threshold may vary somewhat             between banks
" and within a bank across business lines and/or event types"
             however
 particular thresholds should be broadly consistent with those used             by peer banks
           
3
 aside from information on gross loss amounts
 a bank should collect           information about  date of  event
 any recoveries of gross loss           amounts
 as well as some descriptive information about  drivers or causes           of  loss event
 the level of detail of any descriptive information should be           commensurate with  size of  gross loss amount
         
4
 a bank must develop specific criteria for assigning loss data arising from an           event in a centralised function 
eg an information technology department
 or           an activity  spans more than one business line
 as well as from related           events over time
         
5
 operational risk losses  are related to credit risk and have historically           been included in banks credit risk databases 
eg collateral management           failures
 will continue to be treated as credit risk for  purposes of           calculating minimum regulatory capital under this framework
 therefore
           such losses will not be subject to  operational risk capital requirements
           neverless
 for  purposes of internal operational risk management
           banks must identify all material operational risk losses consistent with            scope of  definition of operational risk 
as set out in ope10
1 and  loss           event types outlined in ope30
11
""
 including those related to credit risk
 such           material operational risk-related credit risk losses should be flagged           separately within a banks internal operational risk database
 the materiality           of se losses may vary between banks
" and within a bank across business           lines and/or event types"
 materiality thresholds should be broadly consistent           with those used by peer banks
         
6
 operational risk losses  are related to market risk are treated as           operational risk for  purposes of calculating minimum regulatory capital           under this framework and will refore be subject to  operational risk           capital requirements
     this applies to all banks
 including those  may only now be                   designing ir credit risk and operational risk databases
          30
16 a banks operational risk measurement system must use relevant external data        
"eir public data and/or pooled industry data"
""
 especially when re is reason        to believe   bank is exposed to infrequent
 yet potentially severe
 losses
        these external data should include data on actual loss amounts
 information on         scale of business operations where  event occurred
 information on         causes and circumstances of  loss events
 or or information  would help        in assessing  relevance of  loss event for or banks
 a bank must have a         systematic process for determining  situations for which external data must be         used and  methodologies used to incorporate  data 
eg scaling
 qualitative         adjustments
 or informing  development of improved scenario analysis
""
 the         conditions and practices for external data use must be regularly reviewed
         documented
 and subject to periodic independent review
    30
17 a bank must use scenario analysis of expert opinion in conjunction with external        data to evaluate its exposure to high-severity events
 this approach draws on         knowledge of experienced business managers and risk management experts to        derive reasoned assessments of plausible severe losses
 for instance
 se expert        assessments could be expressed as parameters of an assumed statistical loss        distribution
 in addition
 scenario analysis should be used to assess  impact of        deviations from  correlation assumptions embedded in  banks operational        risk measurement framework
 in particular
 to evaluate potential losses arising        from multiple simultaneous operational risk loss events
 over time
 such        assessments need to be validated and re-assessed through comparison to actual        loss experience to ensure ir reasonableness
    30
18 in addition to using loss data
 wher actual or scenario-based
 a banks firm
       wide risk assessment methodology must capture key business environment and        internal control factors  can change its operational risk profile
 these factors        will make a banks risk assessments more forward-looking
 more directly reflect         quality of  banks control and operating environments
 help align capital        assessments with risk management objectives
 and recognise both improvements        and deterioration in operational risk profiles in a more immediate fashion
 to        qualify for regulatory capital purposes
  use of se factors in a banks risk        measurement framework must meet  following standards
           
1
 the choice of each factor needs to be justified as a meaningful driver of risk
             based on experience and involving  expert judgment of  affected             business areas
 whenever possible
  factors should be translatable into             quantitative measures  lend mselves to verification
               
2
 the sensitivity of a banks risk estimates to changes in  factors and              relative weighting of  various factors need to be well reasoned
 in             addition to capturing changes in risk due to improvements in risk controls
              framework must also capture potential increases in risk due to greater             complexity of activities or increased business volume
           
3
 the framework and each instance of its application
 including  supporting             rationale for any adjustments to empirical estimates
 must be documented             and subject to independent review within  bank and by supervisors
           
4
 over time
  process and  outcomes need to be validated through             comparison to actual internal loss experience
 relevant external data
 and             appropriate adjustments made
      risk mitigation  30
19 under  ama
 a bank will be allowed to recognise  risk mitigating impact of        insurance in  measures of operational risk used for regulatory minimum        capital requirements
 the recognition of insurance mitigation will be limited to        20% of  total operational risk capital requirements calculated under  ama
    30
20 a banks ability to take advantage of such risk mitigation will depend on        compliance with  following criteria
           
1
 the insurance provider has a minimum claims paying ability rating of a 
or             equivalent
""
           
2
 the insurance policy must have an initial term of no less than one year
 for             policies with a residual term of less than one year
  bank must make             appropriate haircuts reflecting  declining residual term of  policy
 up to             a full 100% haircut for policies with a residual term of 90 days or less
           
3
 the insurance policy has a minimum notice period for cancellation of 90 days
           
4
 the insurance policy has no exclusions or limitations triggered by             supervisory actions or
 in  case of a failed bank
  preclude  bank
             receiver or liquidator from recovering for damages suffered or expenses             incurred by  bank
 except in respect of events occurring after  initiation             of receivership or liquidation proceedings in respect of  bank
 provided               insurance policy may exclude any fine
 penalty
 or punitive damages             resulting from supervisory actions
               
5
 the risk mitigation calculations must reflect  banks insurance coverage in             a manner  is transparent in its relationship to
 and consistent with
              actual likelihood and impact of loss used in  banks overall determination             of its operational risk capital
           
6
 the insurance is provided by a third-party entity
 in  case of insurance             through captives and affiliates
  exposure has to be laid off to an             independent third-party entity
 for example through re-insurance
  meets              eligibility criteria
           
7
 the framework for recognising insurance is well reasoned and documented
           
8
 the bank discloses a description of its use of insurance for  purpose of             mitigating operational risk
    30
21 a banks methodology for recognising insurance under  ama also needs to        capture  following elements through appropriate discounts or haircuts in         amount of insurance recognition
           
1
 the residual term of a policy

 banks meeting se conditions must         include any retained securitisation exposures in ir leverage ratio exposure         measure
 in all or cases
 eg traditional securitisations  do not meet          operational requirements for  recognition of risk transference or syntic         securitisations
  securitised exposures must be included in  leverage ratio         exposure measure

 and to facilitate  implementation of monetary policies
 a         jurisdiction may temporarily exempt central bank reserves from  leverage ratio         exposure measure in exceptional macroeconomic circumstances
 to maintain          same level of resilience provided by  leverage ratio
 a jurisdiction applying this         discretion must also increase  calibration of  minimum leverage ratio         requirement commensurately to offset  impact of exempting central bank         reserves
 in addition
 in order to maintain  comparability and transparency of          basel iii leverage ratio framework
 banks will be required to disclose          impact of any temporary exemption alongside ongoing public disclosure of          leverage ratio without application of such exemption

24 for  purposes of calculating potential future credit exposure to a netting        counterparty for forward foreign exchange contracts and or similar contracts        in which  notional principal amount is equivalent to cash flows
  notional        principal is defined as  net receipts falling due on each value date in each        currency
 the reason for this is  offsetting contracts in  same currency        maturing on  same date will have lower potential future exposure as well as        lower current exposure

25 collateral received in connection with derivative contracts has two countervailing        effects on leverage
           
1
 it reduces counterparty exposure
 but           
2
 it can also increase  economic resources at  disposal of  bank
 as              bank can use  collateral to leverage itself
    30
26 collateral received in connection with derivative contracts does not necessarily        reduce  leverage inherent in a banks derivatives position
 which is generally         case if  settlement exposure arising from  underlying derivative        contract is not reduced
 as a general rule
 collateral received may not be netted        against derivative exposures wher or not netting is permitted under  banks        operative accounting or risk-based framework
 hence
 when calculating         exposure amount by applying lev30
9 to lev30
23
 a bank must not reduce         exposure amount by any collateral received from  counterparty
    30
27 similarly
 with regard to collateral provided
 banks must gross up ir exposure        measure by  amount of any derivatives collateral provided where  provision        of  collateral has reduced  value of ir balance sheet assets under ir        operative accounting framework

28 in  treatment of derivative exposures for  purpose of  leverage ratio
         cash portion of variation margin exchanged between counterparties may be        viewed as a form of pre-settlement payment

1
 for trades not cleared through a qualifying central counterparty 
qccp
              cash received by  recipient counterparty is not segregated
           
2
 variation margin is calculated and exchanged on a daily basis based on mark
            to-market valuation of derivatives positions
           
3
 the cash variation margin is received in  same currency as  currency of             settlement of  derivative contract
           
4
 variation margin exchanged is  full amount  would be necessary to             fully extinguish  mark-to-market exposure of  derivative subject to              threshold and minimum transfer amounts applicable to  counterparty
           
5
 derivatives transactions and variation margins are covered by a single master           netting agreement 
mna
 between  legal entities  are            counterparties in  derivatives transaction
 the mna must explicitly           stipulate   counterparties agree to settle net any payment obligations           covered by such a netting agreement
 taking into account any variation           margin received or provided if a credit event occurs involving eir           counterparty
 the mna must be legally enforceable and effective in all           relevant jurisdictions
 including in  event of default and bankruptcy or           insolvency
     a qccp is defined as in cre50

     a master mna may be deemed to be a single mna for this purpose
    to  extent   criteria in this paragraph include  term                   master netting agreement
 this term should be read as including any                   netting agreement  provides legally enforceable rights of offsets

  credit protection purchased is on a reference obligation which ranks pari             passu with or is junior to  underlying reference obligation of  written             credit derivative in  case of single name credit derivatives

 protection purchased                   on a pool of reference entities may offset protection sold on individual                   reference names if  protection purchased is economically equivalent                   to buying protection separately on each of  individual names in                    pool

 if a written credit derivative had a positive fair value of 20                 on one date and has a negative fair value of 10 on a subsequent                 reporting date
  effective notional amount of  credit derivative                 may be reduced by 10
 the effective notional amount cannot be                 reduced by 30

b
 where no qualifying mna is in place
  current exposure for               transactions with a counterparty must be calculated on a transaction by               transaction basis

 as shown in  following formula
        for sft assets subject to novation and cleared through qccps
 gross                   sft assets recognised for accounting purposes are replaced by                    final contractual exposure
 given  pre-existing contracts have been                   replaced by new legal obligations through  novation process
     gross sft assets recognised for accounting purposes must not                   recognise any accounting netting of cash payables against cash                   receivables 
eg as currently permitted under  ifrs and us gaap                   accounting frameworks
""
 this regulatory treatment has  benefit of                   avoiding inconsistencies from netting which may arise across different                   accounting regimes
    this may apply
 for example
 under us gaap where securities received                   under an sft may be recognised as assets if  recipient has  right                   to rehypocate but has not done so
    this latter condition ensures  any issues arising from  securities                   leg of  sfts do not interfere with  completion of  net                   settlement of  cash receivables and payables

 the lcr standard         and monitoring tools should be applied to all internationally active banks on a         consolidated basis
 but may be used for or banks and on any subset of entities         of internationally active banks as well to ensure greater consistency and a level         playing field between domestic and cross-border banks
 the lcr standard and         monitoring tools should be applied consistently wherever y are applied
    10
2   national supervisors should determine which investments in banking
 securities         and financial entities of a banking group  are not consolidated per lcr10
1         should be considered significant
 taking into account  liquidity impact of such         investments on  group under  lcr standard
 normally
 a non-controlling         investment 
eg a joint venture or minority-owned entity
 can be regarded as         significant if  banking group will be  main liquidity provider of such         investment in times of stress 
for example
 when  or shareholders are non
        banks or where  bank is operationally involved in  day-to-day management         and monitoring of  entitys liquidity risk
""
 national supervisors should agree         with each relevant bank on a case-by-case basis on an appropriate methodology         for how to quantify such potential liquidity draws
 in particular
 those arising from          need to support  investment in times of stress out of reputational         concerns for  purpose of calculating  lcr
 to  extent  such liquidity         draws are not included elsewhere
 y should be treated under or         contingent funding obligations
 as described in lcr40
70
    10
3   regardless of  scope of application of  lcr
 in keeping with principle 6 as         outlined in  principles for sound liquidity risk management and supervision
         a bank should actively monitor and control liquidity risk exposures and funding         needs at  level of individual legal entities
 foreign branches and subsidiaries
         and  group as a whole
 taking into account legal
 regulatory and operational         limitations to  transferability of liquidity
"      differences in home / host liquidity requirements  10"
4   while most of  parameters in  lcr standard are internationally         harmonised
 national differences in liquidity treatment may occur in those items         subject to national discretion 
eg deposit run-off rates
 contingent funding         obligations
 market valuation changes on derivative transactions
 and where         more stringent parameters are adopted by some supervisors
    10
5           when calculating  lcr on a consolidated basis
" a cross-border banking group         should apply  liquidity parameters adopted in  home jurisdiction to all legal         entities being consolidated except for  treatment of retail / small business         deposits  should follow  relevant parameters adopted in host jurisdictions         in which  entities "
branch or subsidiary
 operate
 this approach will enable          stressed liquidity needs of legal entities of  group 
including branches of those         entities
 operating in host jurisdictions to be more suitably reflected
 given          deposit run-off rates in host jurisdictions are more influenced by jurisdiction
        specific factors such as  type and effectiveness of deposit insurance schemes         in place and  behaviour of local depositors
    10
6   home requirements for retail and small business deposits should apply to          relevant legal entities 
including branches of those entities
 operating in host         jurisdictions if
           
1
 re are no host requirements for retail and small business deposits in              particular jurisdictions
           
2
 those entities operate in host jurisdictions  have not implemented              lcr
 or           
3
  home supervisor decides  home requirements should be used              are stricter than  host requirements
      treatment of liquidity transfer restrictions  10
7   as noted in lcr30
21
 as a general principle
 no excess liquidity should be         recognised by a cross-border banking group in its consolidated lcr if re is         reasonable doubt about  availability of such liquidity
 liquidity transfer         restrictions 
eg ring-fencing measures
 non-convertibility of local currency
         foreign exchange controls
 in jurisdictions in which a banking group operates will         affect  availability of liquidity by inhibiting  transfer of high-quality liquid         assets 
hqla
 and fund flows within  group
 the consolidated lcr should         reflect such restrictions in a manner consistent with lcr30
21
 for example
          eligible hqla  are held by a legal entity being consolidated to meet its local         lcr requirements 
where applicable
 can be included in  consolidated lcr to          extent  such hqla are used to cover  total net cash outflows of          entity
 notwithstanding   assets are subject to liquidity transfer restrictions
         if  hqla held in excess of  total net cash outflows are not transferable
         such surplus liquidity should be excluded from  lcr calculation
      10
8   for practical reasons
  liquidity transfer restrictions to be accounted for in          consolidated ratio are confined to existing restrictions imposed under applicable           laws
 regulations and supervisory requirements
 a banking group should have         processes in place to capture all liquidity transfer restrictions to  extent         practicable
 and to monitor  rules and regulations in  jurisdictions in which          group operates and assess ir liquidity implications for  group as a         whole
           there are a number of factors  can impede cross-border liquidity                     flows of a banking group
 many of which are beyond  control of                      group and some of se restrictions may not be clearly incorporated                     into law or may become visible only in times of stress
        currencies  10
9   as outlined in lcr30
29
 while  lcr must be met on a consolidated basis and         reported in a common currency
 supervisors and banks should also be aware of          liquidity needs in each significant currency
 as indicated in  lcr standard
          currencies of  stock of hqla should be similar in composition to          operational needs of  bank
 banks and supervisors cannot assume          currencies will remain transferable and convertible in a stress period
 even for         currencies  in normal times are freely transferable and highly convertible
                                           lcr20                                   calculation                                   this chapter explains how to calculate                                    liquidity coverage ratio

1   the committee has developed  liquidity coverage ratio 
lcr
 to promote          short-term resilience of  liquidity risk profile of banks by ensuring  y         have sufficient high-quality liquid assets 
hqla
 to survive a significant stress         scenario lasting 30 calendar days
    20
2   the scenario for this standard entails a combined idiosyncratic and market-wide         shock  would result in
           
1
  run-off of a proportion of retail deposits
           
2
 a partial loss of unsecured wholesale funding
           
3
 a partial loss of secured
 short-term financing with certain collateral and             counterparties
           
4
 additional contractual outflows  would arise from a downgrade in              banks public credit rating by up to and including three notches
 including             collateral posting requirements
           
5
 increases in market volatilities  impact  quality of collateral or             potential future exposure of derivative positions and thus require larger             collateral haircuts or additional collateral
 or lead to or liquidity needs
           
6
 unscheduled draws on committed but unused credit and liquidity facilities               bank has provided to its clients
 and           
7
  potential need for  bank to buy back debt or honour non-contractual             obligations in  interest of mitigating reputational risk
    20
3   this stress test should be viewed as a minimum supervisory requirement for         banks
 banks are expected to conduct ir own stress tests to assess  level of         liquidity y should hold beyond this minimum
 and construct ir own         scenarios  could cause difficulties for ir specific business activities
 such         internal stress tests should incorporate longer time horizons than  one         mandated by this standard
 banks should share  results of se additional         stress tests with supervisors
    20
4   the lcr has two components
           
1
 value of  stock of hqla in stressed conditions
 and           
2
 total net cash outflows
 calculated according to  scenario parameters             outlined in lcr30 and lcr40
    20
5   the lcr builds on traditional liquidity coverage ratio methodologies used         internally by banks to assess exposure to contingent liquidity events
 the total         net cash outflows for  scenario are to be calculated for 30 calendar days into          future
 the standard requires 
 absent a situation of financial stress
          value of  ratio be no lower than 100% 
ie  stock of hqla should at least         equal total net cash outflows
 on an ongoing basis because  stock of         unencumbered hqla is intended to serve as a defence against  potential         onset of liquidity stress
""
 during periods of stress
 however
 it would be entirely         appropriate for banks to use ir stock of hqla
 reby falling below          minimum
 supervisors will subsequently assess this situation and will give         guidance on usability according to  circumstances
    20
6   in particular
 supervisory decisions regarding a banks use of its hqla should be         guided by consideration of  core objective and definition of  lcr
         supervisors should exercise judgement in ir assessment and account not only         for prevailing macrofinancial conditions
 but also consider forward-looking         assessments of macroeconomic and financial conditions
 in determining a         response
 supervisors should be aware  some actions could be procyclical if         applied in circumstances of market-wide stress
 supervisors should seek to take         se considerations into account on a consistent basis across jurisdictions
           
1
 supervisors should assess conditions at an early stage
 and take actions if             deemed necessary
 to address potential liquidity risk
           
2
 supervisors should allow for differentiated responses to a reported lcr             below 100%
 any potential supervisory response should be proportionate             with  drivers
 magnitude
 duration and frequency of  reported shortfall
           
3
 supervisors should assess a number of firm
and market-specific factors in           determining  appropriate response
 as well as or considerations           related to both domestic and global frameworks and conditions
 potential           considerations include
 but are not limited to
             
a
  reason
s
   lcr fell below 100%
 this includes use of                stock of hqla
 an inability to roll over funding or large unexpected               draws on contingent obligations
 in addition
  reasons may relate to               overall credit
 funding and market conditions
 including liquidity in               credit
 asset and funding markets
 affecting individual banks or all               institutions
 regardless of ir own condition
             
b
  extent to which  reported decline in  lcr is due to a firm
              specific or market-wide shock
             
c
   a banks overall health and risk profile
 including activities
 positions                 with respect to or supervisory requirements
 internal risk systems
                 controls and or management processes
 among ors
             
d
  magnitude
 duration and frequency of  reported decline of hqla
             
e
  potential for contagion to  financial system and additional               restricted flow of credit or reduced market liquidity due to actions to               maintain an lcr of 100%
 and             
f
    availability of or sources of contingent funding such as central                 bank funding
 or or actions by prudential authorities
             
4
 supervisors should have a range of tools at ir disposal to address a             reported lcr below 100%
 banks may use ir stock of hqla in both             idiosyncratic and systemic stress events
 although  supervisory response             may differ between  two
               
a
 at a minimum
 a bank should present an assessment of its liquidity                 position
 including  factors  contributed to its lcr falling below                 100%
  measures  have been and will be taken and                  expectations on  potential length of  situation
 enhanced                 reporting to supervisors should be commensurate with  duration of                  shortfall
               
b
 if appropriate
 supervisors could also require actions by a bank to                 reduce its exposure to liquidity risk
 strengn its overall liquidity risk                 management
 or improve its contingency funding plan
               
c
   however
 in a situation of sufficiently severe system-wide stress
 effects                   on  entire financial system should be considered
 potential measures                   to restore liquidity levels should be discussed
 and should be executed                   over a period of time considered appropriate to prevent additional                   stress on  bank and on  financial system as a whole
           
5
 supervisors responses should be consistent with  overall approach to              prudential framework
     the sound principles require  a bank develop a contingency                     funding plan 
cfp
  clearly sets out strategies for addressing                     liquidity shortfalls
 in both firm-specific and market-wide situations of                     stress
 a cfp should
 among or things
 reflect central bank lending                     programmes and collateral requirements
 including facilities  form                     part of normal liquidity management operations

 with          operational capacity to increase  frequency to weekly or even daily in stressed         situations at  discretion of  supervisors

 for                      characteristics  an asset must meet to be part of  stock of hqla                     and  definition of unencumbered respectively
             faq         faq1        regarding  reform of benchmark reference rates
 what guidance can                      committee provide on  assessment of eligibility of instruments                     as hqla?                       solely for  purpose of implementing benchmark rate reforms
 when                     a type of instrument  references an interbank offered rate 
ibor
                     and has historically qualified as eligible hqla is being replaced with                     an equivalent type of instrument  references an alternative                     references rate
 supervisors can take into account anticipated increases                     in  liquidity of  replacement instrument during  transition                     period when determining wher it qualifies as hqla
        characteristics of hqla  30
2   assets are considered to be hqla if y can be easily and immediately         converted into cash at little or no loss of value
 the liquidity of an asset depends         on  underlying stress scenario
  volume to be monetised and  timeframe         considered
 neverless
 re are certain assets  are more likely to generate         funds without incurring large discounts in sale or repurchase agreement 
repo
         markets due to fire-sales even in times of stress
 this section outlines  factors          influence wher or not  market for an asset can be relied upon to raise         liquidity when considered in  context of possible stresses
 these factors should         assist supervisors in determining which assets
 despite meeting  criteria from         lcr30
40 to lcr30
45
 are not sufficiently liquid in private markets to be included         in  stock of hqla
    30
3   as outlined by  characteristics described below
  test of wher liquid         assets are of high quality is 
 by way of sale or repo
 ir liquidity
        generating capacity is assumed to remain intact even in periods of severe         idiosyncratic and market stress
 lower-quality assets typically fail to meet          test
 an attempt by a bank to raise liquidity from lower-quality assets under         conditions of severe market stress would entail acceptance of a large fire-sale         discount or haircut to compensate for high market risk
 that may not only erode          markets confidence in  bank
 but would also generate mark-to-market         losses for banks holding similar instruments and add to  pressure on ir         liquidity position
 thus encouraging furr fire sales and declines in prices and         market liquidity
 in se circumstances
 private market liquidity for such         instruments is likely to disappear quickly
    30
4   hqla 
except level 2b assets as defined below in lcr30
44 to lcr30
46
 should         ideally be eligible at central banks for intraday liquidity needs and overnight         liquidity facilities
 in  past
 central banks have provided a furr backstop to          supply of banking system liquidity under conditions of severe stress
 central         bank eligibility should thus provide additional confidence  banks are holding         assets  could be used in events of severe stress without damaging          broader financial system
 that in turn would raise confidence in  safety and         soundness of liquidity risk management in  banking system
        in most jurisdictions
 hqla should be central bank eligible in addition                     to being liquid in markets during stressed periods
 in jurisdictions                     where central bank eligibility is limited to an extremely narrow list of                     assets
 a supervisor may allow unencumbered
 non-central bank                     eligible assets  meet  qualifying criteria for level 1 or level 2                     assets to count as part of its stock 
see definition of hqla beginning                     from lcr30
30
""
      30
5   however
 central bank eligibility does not by itself constitute  basis for          categorisation of an asset as hqla
      fundamental characteristics  30
6   low risk
 assets  are less risky tend to have higher liquidity
 high credit         standing of  issuer and a low degree of subordination increase an assets         liquidity
 low sensitivity to interest rate and market risk
 low legal risk
 low         inflation risk and denomination in a convertible currency with low foreign         exchange risk all enhance an assets liquidity
    30
7   ease and certainty of valuation
 an assets liquidity increases if market participants         are more likely to agree on its valuation
 assets with more standardised
         homogenous and simple structures tend to be more fungible
 promoting         liquidity
 the pricing formula of a high-quality liquid asset must be easy to         calculate and not depend on strong assumptions
 the inputs into  pricing         formula must also be publicly available
 in practice
 this should exclude most         structured or exotic products
    30
8   low correlation with risky assets
  stock of hqla should not be subject to         wrong-way 
highly correlated
 risk
 for example
 assets issued by financial         institutions are more likely to be illiquid in times of liquidity stress in  banking         sector
    30
9   listed on a developed and recognised exchange
 being listed increases an assets         transparency
      market-related characteristics
  30
10 active and sizable market
  asset should have active outright sale or repo        markets at all times
 this means 
               
1
 there should be historical evidence of market breadth and market depth
             this could be demonstrated by low bid-ask spreads
 high trading volumes
               and a large and diverse number of market participants
 diversity of market             participants reduces market concentration and increases  reliability of              liquidity in  market
           
2
 there should be robust market infrastructure in place
 the presence of             multiple committed market makers increases liquidity as quotes will most             likely be available for buying or selling hqla
    30
11 low volatility
 assets whose prices remain relatively stable and are less prone to        sharp price declines over time will have a lower probability of triggering forced        sales to meet liquidity requirements
 volatility of traded prices and spreads over        benchmarks are simple proxy measures of market volatility
 there should be        historical evidence of relative stability of market terms 
eg prices and haircuts
        and volumes during stressed periods
    30
12 flight to quality
 historically
  market has shown tendencies to move into se        types of assets in a systemic crisis
 the correlation between proxies of market        liquidity and banking system stress is one simple measure  could be used
      operational requirements  30
13 all assets in  stock of hqla are subject to  following operational        requirements
 the purpose of  operational requirements is to recognise         not all assets outlined in lcr30
40 to lcr30
45  meet  asset class
 risk
       weighting and credit-rating criteria should be eligible for  stock as re are        or operational restrictions on  availability of hqla  can prevent timely        monetisation during a stress period
    30
14 these operational requirements are designed to ensure   stock of hqla is        managed in such a way   bank can
 and is able to demonstrate  it can
        immediately use  stock of assets as a source of contingent funds
 and          stock of assets is available for  bank to convert into cash through outright sale        or repo
 to fill funding gaps between cash inflows and outflows at any time        during  30-day stress period
 with no restriction on  use of  liquidity        generated
  30
15 a bank must periodically monetise a representative proportion of  assets in         stock through repo or outright sale
 in order to test its access to  market
         effectiveness of its processes for monetisation
  availability of  assets
        and to minimise  risk of negative signalling during a period of actual stress
        this requirement for periodic monetisation may be satisfied by transactions        carried out through a banks normal course of business
             faq         faq1        what is a representative proportion of  assets in  stock banks                     are supposed to periodically monetise  through repo or outright                     sale?                       the extent
 subject and frequency of hqla monetisation necessary to                     comply with lcr30
15 should be assessed on a case by case basis
 it is                     generally  responsibility of banks to incorporate  intent of lcr30
                     15 in ir management of liquid assets and be able to demonstrate to                     supervisors an approach which is appropriate rar than ex ante                     stipulations
      30
16 all assets in  stock must be unencumbered
 unencumbered means free of        legal
 regulatory
 contractual or or restrictions on  ability of  bank to        liquidate
 sell
 transfer or assign  asset
 an asset in  stock must not be        pledged 
eir explicitly or implicitly
 to secure
 collateralise or credit-enhance        any transaction
 nor be designated to cover operational costs 
such as rents and        salaries
""
 assets received in reverse repo and securities financing transactions         are held at  bank
 have not been rehypocated
 and are legally and        contractually available for  bank  use
 can be considered as part of  stock        of hqla
 in addition
 assets which qualify for  stock of hqla  have been        pre-positioned or deposited with
 or pledged to
  central bank or a public        sector entity 
pse
 but have not been used to generate liquidity may be included        in  stock
       if a bank has deposited
 pre-positioned or pledged level 1
 level 2 and                     or assets in a collateral pool and no specific securities are assigned                     as collateral for any transactions
 it may assume  assets are                     encumbered in order of increasing liquidity value in  lcr
 ie assets                     ineligible for  stock of hqla are assigned first
 followed by level 2b                     assets
 n level 2a and finally level 1
 this determination must be                     made in compliance with any requirements
 such as concentration or                     diversification
 of  central bank or pse
                 faq         faq1       a bank has a reverse repurchase agreement
 receiving collateral                     consists of a pool of assets including non-hqla
 can  whole portion                    of level 1 and level 2 assets of  collateral basket be counted                    towards hqla 
subject to  or requirements on hqla-eligible                    assets
?                      an hqla-eligible asset received as a component of a pool of collateral                    for a secured transaction 
eg reverse repo
 can be included in  stock                    of hqla 
with associated haircuts
 to  extent  it can be                    monetised separately
           faq2       if a bank pledges a pool of hqla and non-hqla collateral with a                    clearing entity such as a central counterparty against secured funding                    transactions
 may it count any hqla-eligible securities  are held as                    part of  collateral pool
 but remain unused at end-of-day as part of                     stock of hqla? does this requirement apply to derivatives as well?                      the bank may count  unused portion of hqla-eligible collateral                    pledged towards its stock of hqla 
with associated haircuts
""
 if                     bank cannot determine which specific assets remain unused
 it may                    assume  assets are encumbered in order of increasing liquidity                    value
 consistent with  methodology set out in footnote 3 of lcr30
                    assets in a pool  is intended to 
exclusively or additionally
                    collateralise derivatives transactions are not readily available within                     meaning of  operational requirements
      30
17 a bank must exclude from  stock those assets 
 although meeting         definition of unencumbered specified in lcr30
16
  bank does not have         operational capability to monetise to meet outflows during  stress period
        operational capability to monetise assets requires having procedures and        appropriate systems in place
 including providing  function identified in lcr30
        18 with access to all necessary information to execute monetisation of any asset        at any time
 monetisation of  asset must be executable
 from an operational        perspective
 in  standard settlement period for  asset class in  relevant        jurisdiction
    30
18 the stock must be under  control of  function charged with managing         liquidity of  bank 
eg  treasurer
""
 meaning  function has  continuous        authority
 and legal and operational capability
 to monetise any asset in  stock
        control must be evidenced eir by maintaining assets in a separate pool        managed by  function with  sole intent for use as a source of contingent        funds
 or by demonstrating   function can monetise  asset at any point         in  30-day stress period and   proceeds of doing so are available to          function throughout  30-day stress period without directly conflicting with a         stated business or risk-management strategy
 for example
 an asset should not         be included in  stock if  sale of  asset
 without replacement throughout          30-day period
 would remove a hedge  would create an open risk         position in excess of internal limits
    30
19 a bank is permitted to hedge  market risk associated with ownership of         stock of hqla and still include  assets in  stock
 if it chooses to hedge         market risk
  bank must take into account 
in  market value applied to each        asset
  cash outflow  would arise if  hedge were to be closed out early        
in  event of  asset being sold
""
    30
20 in accordance with principle 9 of  sound principles
 a bank should monitor         legal entity and physical location where collateral is held and how it may be        mobilised in a timely manner
 specifically
 it should have a policy in place         identifies legal entities
 geographical locations
 currencies and specific custodial        or bank accounts where hqla are held
 in addition
  bank should determine        wher any such assets should be excluded for operational reasons and        refore have  ability to determine  composition of its stock on a daily        basis
    30
21 as noted in lcr10
7 and lcr10
8
 qualifying hqla  are held to meet        statutory liquidity requirements at  legal entity or sub-consolidated level        
where applicable
 may only be included in  stock at  consolidated level to         extent   related risks 
as measured by  legal entitys or sub
       consolidated groups net cash outflows in  lcr
 are also reflected in         consolidated lcr
 any surplus of hqla held at  legal entity can only be        included in  consolidated stock if those assets would also be freely available to         consolidated 
parent
 entity in times of stress
    30
22 in assessing wher assets are freely transferable for regulatory purposes
 banks        should be aware  assets may not be freely available to  consolidated entity        due to regulatory
 legal
 tax
 accounting or or impediments
 assets held in        legal entities without market access should only be included to  extent         y can be freely transferred to or entities  could monetise  assets
      30
23 in certain jurisdictions
 large
 deep and active repo markets do not exist for        eligible asset classes
 and refore such assets are likely to be monetised         through outright sale
 in se circumstances
 a bank must exclude from  stock         of hqla those assets where re are impediments to sale
 such as large fire-sale         discounts which would cause it to breach minimum solvency requirements
 or         requirements to hold such assets
 including
 but not limited to
 statutory         minimum inventory requirements for market-making
    30
24 banks must not include in  stock of hqla any assets
 or liquidity generated        from assets
 y have received under right of rehypocation
 if  beneficial        owner has  contractual right to withdraw those assets during  30-day stress        period
     refer to lcr40
79 for  appropriate treatment if  contractual                     withdrawal of such assets would lead to a short position 
eg because                      bank had used  assets in longer-term securities financing                     transactions
""
      30
25 assets received as collateral for derivatives transactions  are not segregated        and are legally able to be rehypocated may be included in  stock of hqla        provided   bank records an appropriate outflow for  associated risks as        set out in lcr40
49
    30
26 as stated in principle 8 of  sound principles
 a bank should actively manage its        intraday liquidity positions and risks to meet payment and settlement obligations        on a timely basis under both normal and stressed conditions and thus contribute        to  smooth functioning of payment and settlement systems
 banks and        regulators should be aware   lcr stress scenario does not cover expected        or unexpected intraday liquidity needs
    30
27 while  lcr must be met and reported in a single currency
 banks should be        able to meet ir liquidity needs in each currency and maintain hqla consistent        with  distribution of ir liquidity needs by currency
 the bank should be able        to use  stock to generate liquidity in  currency and jurisdiction in which         net cash outflows arise
 as such
  lcr by currency should be monitored and        reported to allow  bank and its supervisor to track any potential currency        mismatch issues  could arise
 as outlined in srp50
 in managing foreign        exchange liquidity risk
  bank should take into account  risk  its ability        to swap currencies and access  relevant foreign exchange markets may erode        rapidly under stressed conditions
 it should be aware  sudden
 adverse        exchange rate movements could sharply widen existing mismatched positions        and alter  effectiveness of any foreign exchange hedges in place
    30
28 in order to mitigate cliff effects  could arise
 if an eligible liquid asset became        ineligible 
eg due to rating downgrade
""
 a bank is permitted to keep such assets        in its stock of liquid assets for an additional 30 calendar days
 this would allow         bank additional time to adjust its stock as needed or replace  asset
      diversification of  stock of hqla  30
29 the stock of hqla should be well diversified within  asset classes mselves        
except for sovereign debt of  banks home jurisdiction or from  jurisdiction        in which  bank operates
 central bank reserves
 central bank debt securities
        and cash
""
 although some asset classes are more likely to remain liquid        irrespective of circumstances
 ex ante it is not possible to know with certainty        which specific assets within each asset class might be subject to shocks ex post
        banks should refore have policies and limits in place in order to avoid        concentration with respect to asset types
 issue and issuer types
 and currency        
consistent with  distribution of net cash outflows by currency
 within asset        classes
      definition of hqla  30
30 the stock of hqla should comprise assets with  characteristics outlined in        lcr30
2 to lcr30
12
 this section describes  type of assets  meet se        characteristics and can refore be included in  stock
    30
31 there are two categories of assets  can be included in  stock
 assets to be        included in each category are those   bank is holding on  first day of         stress period
 irrespective of ir residual maturity
 level 1 assets can be        included without limit
 while level 2 assets can only comprise up to 40% of         stock
    30
32            some jurisdictions may have an insufficient supply of level 1 assets 
or both level          1 and level 2 assets
 in ir domestic currency to meet  aggregate demand          of banks with significant exposures in this currency
 to address this situation
           committee has developed alternative treatments for holdings in  stock of          hqla
 which are expected to apply to a limited number of currencies and          jurisdictions
 these alternative treatments and  eligibility criteria are set out in          lcr31
    30
33 supervisors may also choose to include within level 2 an additional class of        assets 
level 2b assets
""
 if included
 se assets must not comprise more than        15% of  total stock of hqla
 they must also be included within  overall        40% cap on level 2 assets
    30
34 the 40% cap on level 2 assets and  15% cap on level 2b assets must be        determined after  application of required haircuts
 and after taking into        account  unwind of short-term securities financing transactions and collateral        swap transactions maturing within 30 calendar days  involve  exchange of        hqla
    30
35 the maximum amount of adjusted level 2 assets is equal to two-thirds of         adjusted amount of level 1 assets after haircuts have been applied
 the        calculation of  40% cap on level 2 assets will take into account any reduction        in eligible level 2b assets on account of  15% cap on level 2b assets
        when determining  calculation of  15% and 40% caps
                      supervisors may
 as an additional requirement
 separately consider                       size of  pool of level 2 and level 2b assets on an unadjusted basis
      30
36 furr
  calculation of  15% cap on level 2b assets must take into account         impact on  stock of hqla of  amounts of hqla involved in secured        funding
 secured lending and collateral swap transactions maturing within 30        calendar days
" the maximum amount of adjusted level 2b assets is equal to         ratio of 15/85 times  sum of  adjusted amounts of level 1 and level 2a        assets"
 or
 in cases where  40% cap is binding
" up to a maximum of 1/4 times         adjusted amount of level 1 assets"
 both after haircuts have been applied

4   jurisdictions are not limited to one option
 however
  usage of any of          above options must be constrained by a limit specified by supervisors in         jurisdictions whose currency is eligible for  alternative treatment
 the limit         should be expressed in terms of  maximum amount of hqla associated with          use of  options 
wher individually or in combination
  a bank is         allowed to include in its liquidity coverage ratio

""
 as a percentage of          total amount of hqla  bank is required to hold in  currency concerned

1
 in  case of option 1
  amount of committed liquidity facilities granted             by  relevant central bank
 for a fee
           
2
 in  case of option 2
  amount of foreign currency hqla used to cover              shortfall of hqla in  domestic currency

3
 in  case of option 3
  amount of level 2 assets held

     the required amount of hqla in  domestic currency includes any                     regulatory buffer 
ie above  100% lcr standard
   supervisor                     may reasonably impose on  bank concerned based on its liquidity                     risk profile
      31
5   if
 for example
  maximum level of usage of  options is set at 80%
 it means          a bank adopting  options
 eir individually or in combination
 would         only be allowed to include hqla associated with  options 
after applying any         relevant haircut
 up to 80% of  required amount of hqla in  relevant         currency
 thus
 at least 20% of  hqla requirement would need to be met by         level 1 assets in  relevant currency
 the maximum usage of  options is         constrained by  banks actual shortfall of hqla in  currency concerned
    for example
 if a bank has used option 1 and option 3 to  extent                      it has been granted an option 1 facility of 10%
 and held level 2                     assets of 55% after haircut 
both in terms of  required amount of                     hqla in  domestic currency

 15%
 additional level 2a assets used
""
      31
6   the maximum level of usage should be consistent with  projected size of          hqla shortfall faced by banks subject to  lcr in  currency concerned
         taking into account all relevant factors  may affect  size of  shortfall         over time
 the supervisor should explain how this level is derived
 and justify why         this is supported by insufficient hqla in  banking system
      31
7                 a bank must keep its supervisor informed of its usage of  options so as to         enable  supervisor to manage  aggregate usage of  options in          jurisdiction and to monitor
 where necessary
  banks using such options         observe  relevant supervisory requirements
    31
8   while bank-by-bank approval by  supervisor is not required for use of          alternative liquidity approaches
 individual supervisors may still consider         providing specific approval for banks to use  options should this be warranted         based on ir jurisdiction-specific circumstances
 for example
 use of option 1         will typically require central bank approval of  committed facility
    31
9   in general
 a bank  needs to use  options should not be allowed to use         such options above  level required to meet its lcr 
including any reasonable         buffer above  100% standard  may be imposed by  supervisor
""
         however supervisors may consider wher this should be accommodated under         certain circumstances
 banks may wish to do so for a number of reasons
 for         example
 y may want to have an additional liquidity facility in anticipation of         tight market conditions
 supervisors should have a process 
eg through periodic         reviews
 for ensuring   alternative hqla held by banks are not excessive         compared with ir actual need
 in addition
 banks should not intentionally         replace ir stock of level 1 or level 2 assets with ineligible assets to create a         larger liquidity shortfall for economic reasons or orwise
    31
10 a bank must demonstrate  it has taken reasonable steps to use level 1 and        level 2 assets and reduce  amount of liquidity risk 
as measured by reducing        net cash outflows in  lcr
 to improve its lcr
 before applying an alternative        treatment
 holding an hqla portfolio is not  only way to mitigate a banks        liquidity risk
 for example
 a bank could improve  matching of its assets and        liabilities
 attract stable funding sources
 or reduce its longer-term assets
 banks        should not treat  use of  options simply as an economic choice         maximises  profits of  bank through  selection of alternative hqla        based primarily on yield considerations
 the liquidity characteristics of an        alternative hqla portfolio should be considered to be more important than its        net yield
      31
11 in order to ensure  banks usage of  options is not out of line with         availability of level 1 assets within  jurisdiction
 supervisors may set a        minimum amount of level 1 assets to be held by each bank  is consistent        with  availability of level 1 assets in  market
 a bank must n ensure         it is able to hold and maintain level 1 assets not less than  minimum amount        when applying  options
      option 1  contractual committed liquidity facilities from  relevant  central bank
 for a fee  31
12 under option 1
 banks may access contractual committed liquidity facilities        provided by  relevant central bank 
ie relevant given  currency in question
        for a fee
 these committed liquidity facilities should be distinct and separate from        regular central bank standing arrangements
 as se committed liquidity        facilities must meet certain criteria
 in particular
 se facilities must be        established contractual arrangements between  central bank and         commercial bank with a maturity date which
 at a minimum
 falls outside  30
       day lcr window
 furr
  contract must be irrevocable prior to maturity and        must not involve an ex post credit decision by  central bank
 such facilities        must also incur a fee for  facility which is charged regardless of  amount
 if        any
 drawn down against  facility
 and  fee must be set so  both banks         claim  facility to meet  lcr and banks  do not have similar financial        incentives to reduce ir exposure to liquidity risk
 that is
  fee should be set        so   net yield on  assets used to secure  facility should not be higher        than  net yield on a representative portfolio of level 1 and level 2 assets
 after        adjusting for any material differences in credit risk
 a jurisdiction seeking to adopt        option 1 should justify   fee is suitably set in a manner as prescribed in        this paragraph
      option 2  foreign currency hqla to cover domestic liquidity needs  31
13 under option 2
 supervisors may permit banks  evidence a shortfall of hqla        in  domestic currency 
ie insufficient domestic currency hqla relative to        domestic currency liquidity risk
 to hold hqla in a currency  does not match         currency of  associated liquidity risk
 however
  resulting currency        mismatch positions must be justifiable and controlled within limits agreed by        ir supervisors
 supervisors should restrict such positions within levels        consistent with  banks foreign exchange risk management capacity and needs        and ensure  such positions relate to currencies  are freely and reliably        convertible
 are effectively managed by  bank
 and would not pose undue risk        to its financial strength
 in managing those positions
  bank should take into        account  risk  its ability to swap currencies and its access to  relevant        foreign exchange markets may erode rapidly under stressed conditions
 it should        also take into account  sudden
 adverse exchange rate movements could        sharply widen existing mismatch positions and alter  effectiveness of any        foreign exchange hedges in place
    31
14 to account for foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency hqla used        to cover liquidity needs in  domestic currency
 such liquid assets must be        subject to a minimum haircut of 8% for major currencies  are active in global        foreign exchange markets
 for or currencies
 jurisdictions should increase         haircut to an appropriate level on  basis of historical 
monthly
 exchange rate        volatilities between  currency pair over an extended period of time
 if         domestic currency is formally pegged to anor currency under an effective        mechanism
  haircut for  pegged currency may be lowered to a level         reflects  limited exchange rate risk under  peg arrangement
 to qualify for        this treatment
  jurisdiction concerned should demonstrate  effectiveness        of its currency peg mechanism and assess  long-term prospect of keeping         peg
       these refer to currencies  exhibit significant and active market                     turnover in  global foreign currency market 
eg  average market                     turnover of  currency as a percentage of  global foreign currency                     market turnover over a ten-year period is not lower than 10%
""
    as an illustration
  exchange rate volatility data used for deriving                      foreign exchange haircut may be based on  30-day moving                     foreign exchange price volatility data 
mean 
 3 standard deviations
                     of  currency pair over a ten-year period
 adjusted to align with                      30-day time horizon of  lcr
          31
15 haircuts for foreign currency hqla used under option 2 must apply to hqla in        excess of a threshold specified by supervisors which must not be greater than        25%
 this is to accommodate a certain level of currency mismatch  may        commonly exist among banks in ir ordinary course of business
      the threshold for applying  haircut under option 2 refers to                      amount of foreign currency hqla used to cover liquidity needs in                      domestic currency as a percentage of total net cash outflows in                      domestic currency
 hence under a threshold of 25%
 a bank using                     option 2 must apply  haircut to  portion of foreign currency                     hqla in excess of 25%  are used to cover liquidity needs in                      domestic currency
      31
16 a bank using option 2 must demonstrate  its foreign exchange risk        management system is able to measure
 monitor and control  foreign        exchange risk resulting from  currency-mismatched hqla positions
 in        addition
  bank must show  it can reasonably convert  currency
       mismatched hqla to liquidity in  domestic currency when required
        particularly in a stress scenario
 to mitigate  risk  excessive currency        mismatch may interfere with  objectives of  framework
  bank supervisor        should only allow banks  are able to measure
 monitor and control         foreign exchange risk arising from  currency mismatched hqla positions to        use this option
 as  hqla  are eligible under option 2 can be        denominated in different foreign currencies
 banks must assess  convertibility        of those foreign currencies in a stress scenario
 as participants in  foreign        exchange market
 y are in  best position to assess  depth of  foreign        exchange swap or spot market for converting those assets to  required        liquidity in  domestic currency in times of stress
 the supervisor should also        restrict  currencies of  assets  are eligible under option 2 to those         have been historically proven to be convertible into  domestic currency in        times of stress
      option 3  additional use of level 2 assets with a higher haircut  31
17 this option addresses currencies for which re are insufficient level 1 assets
 as        determined by reference to  qualifying principles and criteria
 but where re        are sufficient level 2a assets
 under this option
 supervisors may permit banks         evidence a shortfall of hqla in  domestic currency 
ie relative to        domestic currency liquidity risk
 to hold additional level 2a assets in  stock of        hqla
 these additional level 2a assets must be subject to a minimum haircut of        20%
 ie 5% higher than  15% haircut applicable to level 2a assets  are        included in  40% cap
 the higher haircut should cover any additional price and        market liquidity risks arising from increased holdings of level 2a assets beyond         40% cap and provide a disincentive for banks to use this option based on        yield considerations
 supervisors must conduct an analysis to assess wher         additional haircut is sufficient for level 2a assets in ir markets
 and should        increase  haircut if this is warranted to achieve  purpose for which it is        intended
 supervisors should explain and justify  outcome of  analysis        
including  level of increase in  haircut
 if applicable
""
 any level 2b assets        held by  bank must remain subject to  cap of 15%
 regardless of         amount of or level 2 assets held
   supervisors should seek to avoid a situation where  cost of holding a                     portfolio  benefits from this option is lower than  cost of holding                     a oretical compliant portfolio of level 1 and level 2 assets
 after                     adjusting for any material differences in credit risk
      31
18 a bank using option 3 must be able to manage  price risk associated with         additional level 2a assets
 as  quality of level 2a assets is lower than  for        level 1 assets
 increasing its composition would increase  price risk and hence         volatility of  banks stock of hqla
 to mitigate  uncertainty of        performance of this option
 banks must demonstrate   values of  assets        under stress are sufficient
 at a minimum
 y must be able to conduct stress        tests to ascertain   value of its stock of hqla remains sufficient to support        its lcr during a market-wide stress event
 the bank should take a higher haircut        
ie higher than  supervisor-imposed option 3 haircut
 on  value of         level 2a assets if  stress test results suggest   minimum haircut        imposed by supervisors would be insufficient to cover  assets price and        market liquidity risks
        31
19 a bank using option 3 must show  it can reasonably liquidate  additional        level 2a assets in a stress scenario
 with additional reliance on level 2a assets
 it        is essential to ensure   market for se assets has sufficient depth
 this           standard may be implemented in several ways
 but should be more severe than          requirements associated with level 2 assets within  40% cap
 because         increased reliance on level 2a assets would increase concentration risk on an         aggregate level
 thus affecting market liquidity
 the supervisor may
           
1
 require  level 2a assets  exceed  40% cap meet higher qualifying             criteria 
eg minimum credit rating of aa
 or aa instead of aa-

 based on  requirements set out in         three criteria mentioned above
 the assessment should also include wher         jurisdictions approach to adopting  options is in line with  alternative        treatment set out in lcr31

39 the jurisdiction should explain its policy towards  adoption of  options
        including which of  options will be used and  estimated 
and maximum         allowable
 extent of usage by  banking sector

 for example
  jurisdiction may limit  amount of        option 1 commitments to a certain proportion of its gdp and justify why this        level is suitable for its banking system
 the process should address situations        where  aggregate facilities are approaching or have breached  limit

43 a jurisdiction intending to adopt option 2 should demonstrate  it has a        mechanism in place to control  foreign exchange risk arising from banks        holdings in foreign currency hqla under this option
 this is because such foreign        currency asset holdings to cover domestic currency liquidity needs may be        exposed to  risk of decline in  liquidity value of those foreign currency        assets should exchange rates move adversely when  assets are converted into         domestic currency
 especially in times of stress
    31
44 this control mechanism should cover  following elements
             
1
 the jurisdiction should ensure   use of option 2 is confined only to           foreign currencies which provide a reliable source of liquidity in  domestic           currency in stressed market conditions
 in this regard
  jurisdiction should           specify  currencies and broad types of hqla denominated in those           currencies allowable under this option
 based on prudent criteria
 the           suitability of  currencies should be reviewed whenever significant changes           in  external environment warrant a review
         
2
 the jurisdiction should explain why each of  allowable currencies is           selected
 including an analysis of  historical exchange rate volatility
 and           turnover size in  foreign exchange market
 of  currency pair 
eg based           on statistics for each of  past three to five years
""
 in case a currency is           selected for or reasons
  justifications should be clearly stated to           support its inclusion for option 2 purposes
 the selection of currencies           should take into account  following aspects
             
a
  currency should be freely transferable and convertible into                domestic currency
             
b
  currency should be liquid and active in  relevant foreign               exchange market
  methodology and basis of this assessment should               be documented
             
c
    currency should not exhibit significant historical exchange rate                 volatility against  domestic currency
 and             
d
 in  case of a currency which is pegged to  domestic currency
               re should be a formal mechanism in place for maintaining  peg               rate
 relevant information about  mechanism and past ten-year               statistics on exchange rate volatility of  currency pair showing                effectiveness of  peg arrangement should be documented
               
3
 hqla in  allowable currencies used for option 2 purposes must be           subject to haircuts as prescribed under this framework 
ie at least 8% for           major currencies
""
 the jurisdiction should set a higher haircut for or           currencies where  exchange rate volatility against  domestic currency           is much higher
 based on a methodology  compares  historical 
eg           monthly
 exchange rate volatilities between  currency pair concerned over           an extended period of time
 where  allowable currency is formally           pegged to  domestic currency
 a lower haircut may be used to reflect           limited exchange rate risk under  peg arrangement
 to qualify for this           treatment
  jurisdiction should demonstrate  effectiveness of its           currency peg mechanism and  long-term prospect of keeping  peg
           where a threshold for applying  haircut under option 2 is adopted 
see           lcr31
15
""
  level of  threshold must not be more than 25%
         
4
 regular information should be collected from banks in respect of ir           holding of allowable foreign currency hqla for lcr purposes to enable           supervisory assessment of  foreign exchange risk associated with banks           holdings of such assets
 both individually and in aggregate
         
5
 there should be an effective means to control  foreign exchange risk           assumed by banks
 the control mechanism
 and how it is to be applied to           banks
 should be elaborated
 in particular
             
a
 re should be prescribed criteria for allowing individual banks to use               option 2
             
b
  approach to assessing wher  estimated holdings of foreign               currency hqla by individual banks using option 2 are consistent with               ir foreign exchange risk management capacity 
see lcr31
13
 should               be explained
 and             
c
   re should be a system for setting currency mismatch limits to control                 banks maximum foreign currency exposures under option 2
       for example
 clarification may be necessary in cases where only central                     government debt will be allowed
 or level 1 securities issued by                     multilateral development banks in some currencies will be allowed
    for example
  central banks of  two currencies concerned may                     have entered into special foreign exchange swap agreements                      facilitate  flow of liquidity between  currencies
     this is relative to  exchange rate volatilities between  domestic                     currency and or foreign currencies with which  domestic currency                     is traded
     these currencies refer to those  exhibit significant and active                     market turnover in  global foreign currency market 
eg  average                     market turnover of  currency as a percentage of  global foreign                     currency market turnover over a ten-year period is not lower than                     10%

45 with  adoption of option 3
  increase in holdings of level 2a assets within         banking sector 
to substitute for level 1 assets which are of higher quality but        in shortage
 may give rise to additional price and market liquidity risks
 especially        in times of stress when concentrated asset holdings have to be liquidated
 in        order to mitigate this risk
  jurisdiction intending to adopt option 3 should        ensure  only level 2a assets  are of comparable quality to level 1 assets        in  domestic currency are allowed to be used under this option 
ie to exceed         40% cap
""
 level 2b assets must remain subject to  15% cap
 the        jurisdiction should demonstrate how this can be achieved in its supervisory        framework
 having regard to  following aspects
           
1
 the adoption of higher qualifying standards for additional level 2a assets
             apart from fulfilling all  qualifying criteria for level 2a assets
 additional             requirements should be imposed to ensure  assets provide adequate             liquidity value
 for example
 supervisors may require  minimum credit             rating of se additional level 2a assets to be aa or aa
 instead of aa-
             and may impose more stringent qualitative and quantitative criteria
 these             assets may also be required to be central bank eligible
           
2
 the inclusion of a prudent diversification requirement for banks using             option 3
 banks should be required to diversify holdings of level 2 assets             among different issuers and asset classes to  extent feasible in a given             national market
 the jurisdiction should illustrate how this diversification             requirement is to be applied to banks
      31
46 the jurisdiction should provide statistical evidence to substantiate  level 2a        assets 
used under option 3
 and level 1 assets in  domestic currency are        generally of comparable quality in terms of  maximum decline in price during        a relevant historical period of significant liquidity stress

 the requirements may differ        depending on  option to be used as well as jurisdiction-specific        considerations
 the scope of se requirements will generally cover         following areas
          
1
 the jurisdiction should devise  supervisory requirements governing            banks usage of  options
 having regard to  guidance set out in this            chapter
 any bank-specific requirements should be communicated to             affected banks
          
2
 banks using  options should be informed of  minimum amount of            level 1 assets  y are required to hold in  relevant currency
 the            jurisdiction should set a minimum level for banks in  jurisdiction
 this            should complement  requirement under lcr31

3
 in order to control  usage of  options within  banking system

under each or all of             options
 y are allowed to hold
 for example
 if  maximum usage            level is 70%
 a bank should maintain at least 30% of its hqla stock in level 1            assets in  relevant currency
 the maximum level of usage of  options            set by  jurisdiction should be consistent with  calculations and            projections used to support its compliance with principles 1 and 2
          
4
 the jurisdiction may apply additional haircuts to banks  use  options            to limit  uncertainty of performance
 or mitigate  risks of non
           performance
 of  options used

 this may be performed through a        combination of off-site analysis of information collected
 prudential interviews        with banks and on-site examinations as necessary
 for example
 an on-site review        may be necessary to determine  quality of a banks foreign exchange risk        management in order to assess  extent which  bank should be allowed to        use option 2 to satisfy its lcr requirements

 however
 any amount in excess of                      deposit insurance limit must be treated as less stable
 for example

 n 100 would be considered fully insured and                     treated as stable deposits while 50 would be treated as less stable                     deposits
 however if  deposit insurance scheme only covered a                     percentage of  funds from  first currency unit 
eg 90% of                      deposit amount up to a limit of 100
 n  entire 150 deposit would                     be less stable

1
  insurance scheme is based on a system of prefunding via  periodic             collection of levies on banks with insured deposits
           
2
  scheme has adequate means of ensuring ready access to additional             funding in  event of a large call on its reserves
 eg an explicit and legally               binding guarantee from  government
 or a standing authority to borrow             from  government

 including customer         short positions  do not have a specified contractual maturity
 the amount of         outflow must be calculated based on  amount of funds raised through          transaction

 and domestic can be                     defined as a jurisdiction where a bank is legally incorporated

 however
 lcr40
46                    makes references to customer shorts and  treatment is different
                      the treatments of customer shorts versus firm shorts are separate and                    distinct and for this reason are addressed in two separate paragraphs
                    customer shorts are considered equivalent to or secured financing                    transactions
 as  proceeds from  customers short sale may be re
                   used by  facilitating bank to finance  purchase or borrowing of                     shorted security
 contrary to firm short positions
 customer short                    positions are initiated and maintained at  discretion of                     customer
 and refore  availability of this financing may be                    uncertain during a period of stress
 these characteristics explain why                    customer shorts are treated in accordance with  run-off assumption                    in lcr40
48

47 due to  high quality of level 1 assets
 no reduction in funding availability        against se assets is assumed to occur
 moreover
 no reduction in funding        availability is expected for any maturing secured funding transactions with         banks domestic central bank
 a reduction in funding availability must be        assigned to maturing transactions backed by level 2 assets equivalent to         required haircuts
 a 25% factor may be applied for maturing secured funding        transactions with  banks domestic sovereign
 multilateral development banks
        or domestic pses  have a 20% or lower risk weight
 when  transactions are        backed by assets or than level 1 or level 2a assets
 in recognition  se        entities are unlikely to withdraw secured funding from banks in a time of market
       wide stress
 this treatment
 however
 may be applied only to outstanding secured        funding transactions
 unused collateral or merely  capacity to borrow
 as        determined at  end of  day for  reporting date

note
 it is not uncommon for a                     banks overseas branch to conduct repo transactions with  central                     bank of  host jurisdiction

 this may be assumed when                      overseas branch has equal access to central bank funding as domestic                     banks and where it seems reasonable  this equal treatment will                     remain in  context of central bank measures in times of severe                     idiosyncratic or market-wide stress

48 for all or maturing transactions  run-off factor is 100%
 including        transactions where a bank has satisfied customers short positions with its own        long inventory
 all secured transactions maturing within 30 days should be        reported according to  collateral actually pledged as of close of business on         lcr measurement date
 if  bank pledges a pool of assets and cannot        determine which specific assets in  collateral pool are used to collateralise         transactions with a residual maturity greater than 30 days
 it may assume         assets are encumbered to se transactions in order of increasing liquidity value
        consistent with  methodology set out in lcr30

 in such a way  assets        with  lowest liquidity value in  lcr are assigned to  transactions with         longest residual maturities first

 expected contractual derivative cash inflows and        outflows
 cash flows may be calculated on a net basis 
ie inflows can offset        outflows
 by counterparty only where a valid master netting agreement exists
        banks should exclude from such calculations those liquidity requirements         would result from increased collateral needs due to market value movements or        declines in value of collateral posted

 for transactions involving a delivery obligation         can be fulfilled with a variety of asset classes
 delivery of  least valuable asset        possible 
cheapest to deliver
 must be assumed
 this should apply        symmetrically to both  inflow and outflow perspective
 such   obligor is        assumed to deliver  security with  lowest liquidity value
 cash flows arising        from foreign exchange derivative transactions  involve a full exchange of        principal amounts on a simultaneous basis

 may be        reflected as a net cash flow figure
 even where those transactions are not covered        by a master netting agreement

 drawdown of contingent facilities
 or early repayment of        existing liabilities upon  banks downgrade by a recognised credit rating        organisation
 the scenario refore requires  for each contract in which        downgrade triggers exist
  bank assumes  100% of this additional        collateral or cash outflow must be posted for any downgrade up to and including        a 3-notch downgrade of  banks long-term credit rating
 triggers linked to a        banks short-term rating should be assumed to be triggered at  corresponding        long-term rating in accordance with published ratings criteria
 the impact of         downgrade must consider impacts on all types of margin collateral and        contractual triggers which change rehypocation rights for non-segregated        collateral

59 drawdowns on committed credit and liquidity facilities
 for  purpose of         standard
 credit and liquidity facilities are defined as explicit contractual        agreements or obligations to extend funds at a future date to retail or wholesale        counterparties
 these facilities only include contractually irrevocable 
committed
        or conditionally revocable agreements to extend funds in  future
         unconditionally revocable facilities  are unconditionally cancellable by          bank 
in particular
 those without a precondition of a material change in          credit condition of  borrower
 are excluded from this section and included in         lcr40
67
 these off-balance sheet facilities or funding commitments can have         long
or short-term maturities
 with short-term facilities frequently renewing or         automatically rolling over
 in a stressed environment
 it will likely be difficult for         customers drawing on facilities of any maturity
 even short-term maturities
 to be         able to quickly pay back  borrowings
 therefore
 all facilities  are assumed         to be drawn 
as outlined in  paragraphs below
 must be assumed to remain         outstanding without repayment
 regardless of maturity
    40
60 the currently undrawn portion of se facilities may be calculated net of any        hqla eligible for  stock of hqla
 if  hqla have already been posted as        collateral by  counterparty to secure  facilities or  are contractually        obliged to be posted when  counterparty will draw down  facility

 does this requirement apply broadly to all unsettled                 trades
 ie does it also apply to open and failed trades
 or does it                 only apply to forwards? banks which apply settlement date accounting                 for open trades would not have any open trades on ir balance                 sheet and refore this requirement might create an unlevel playing                 field for different accounting frameworks
                   unsettled transactions are addressed in  second to last paragraph of                  response to lcr40
74 faq1
 it refers to any sales or purchases                  are executed but not yet settled at reporting date and follows                  approach set out for forward transactions
 it captures both open and                 failed trades if settlement is expected within 30 days irrespective of                  balance sheet treatment
 in doing so
  response to lcr40
74                 faq1 allows for a symmetrical treatment by applying or cash                 outflows to executed but not yet settled purchases of non-hqla and
                 subject to national discretion
 or cash inflows to executed but not                 yet settled sales
" while unsettled sales/purchases of hqla can be                 ignored"

"ie no repo                 /reverse repo or collateral swap"
 if  assets will be returned or can be                 recalled during  next 30 days? are se assets eligible hqla on                  side of  lender or borrower?                   these assets do not count towards  stock of hqla for eir                  lender or  borrower

           faq4        does lcr40
"74 faq3 apply to assets borrowed/lent on an unsecured                     basis only and not to secured transactions? is it correct to interpret                       basel committee means reused when it uses  wording furr                     offsetting transaction?                       lcr40"

 is  hqla eligibility of  assets on  part of eir                      borrower or  lender
 in this context
 it is assumed   borrower                     has not reused  assets as this would have made  question of                     hqla eligibility obsolete anyway
 the reuse of  collateral by                      borrower
 however
 introduces an outflow because  borrower may                     have to source se securities if  borrowing arrangement is not                     extended
        cash inflows  40

 does  concept of                     collateral substitution also apply to inflows for secured borrowing                     transactions
 ie can a bank take an inflow where it has  contractual                     right to receive hqla if it was able to pledge available non-hqla                     collateral to a secured lender?                       the risks associated with collateral substitution on secured lending                     transactions with a residual maturity greater than 30 days should be                     considered as a contingent outflow in accordance with lcr40
55
 the                     contractual right to substitute hqla collateral for lower-quality or non
                    hqla collateral would be a contingent inflow

 however
 lcr40
46                 makes references to customer shorts and  treatment is different?                   the treatments of customer shorts versus firm shorts are separate and                 distinct and for this reason are addressed in two separate paragraphs
                 customer shorts are considered equivalent to or secured financing                 transactions
 as  proceeds from  customers short sale may be re
                used by  facilitating bank to finance  purchase or borrowing of                  shorted security
 contrary to firm short positions
 customer short                 positions are initiated and maintained at  discretion of                  customer
 and refore  availability of this financing may be                 uncertain during a period of stress

 it is intended to                 point out   bank must be aware  such short positions may                 be extended
 which would require  bank to roll  secured lending                 transaction or to purchase  securities in order to keep  short                 positions covered
 in eir case
  secured lending transaction would                 not lead to a cash inflow for  banks liquidity situation in a way                  it can be considered in  lcr
 for customer shorts
 lcr40
79 only                 refers to those  could be extended beyond  30-day horizon
 so                  reverse repo can be considered to have a maturity within  30

80 in  case of a banks short positions
 if  short position is being covered by an        unsecured security borrowing

        leading to a 100% outflow of eir cash or hqla to secure  borrowing
 or        cash to close out  short position by buying back  security

 however

81 despite  rollover assumptions in lcr40
78 and lcr40
79
 a bank should        manage its collateral such  it is able to fulfil obligations to return collateral        whenever  counterparty decides not to roll-over any reverse repo or securities        lending transaction
 this is especially  case for non-hqla collateral
 since        such outflows are not captured in  lcr framework

81 does not address specific cash flows
 rar
 it calls to mind                      a bank should be prepared to return any received collateral as                     soon as it may be recalled by  provider irrespective of  treatment                     in  lcr

 such facilities must receive a 0% inflow rate
 meaning  this scenario        does not consider inflows from committed credit or liquidity facilities
 this is to        reduce  contagion risk of liquidity shortages at one bank causing shortages at        or banks and to reflect  risk  or banks may not be in a position to        honour credit facilities
 or may decide to incur  legal and reputational risk        involved in not honouring  commitment

83 for all or types of transactions
 eir secured or unsecured

 fee or interest        associated with an open maturity loan

                   note  hqla collateral held by a bank on  first day of  lcr                 horizon may count towards  stock of hqla even if it is sold or                 repoed forward
                       unsettled sales and purchases of hqla can be ignored in  lcr
 the                 cash flows arising from sales and purchases of non-hqla  are                 executed but not yet settled at reporting date count towards or                 cash inflows and or cash outflows
                   note  any outflows or inflows of hqla in  next 30 days in                  context of forward and unsettled transactions are only considered if                  assets do or will count toward  banks stock of hqla
 outflows and                 inflows of hqla-type assets  are or will be excluded from  bank                 s stock of hqla due to operational requirements are treated like                 outflows or inflows of non-hqla
         faq2      or contractual outflow is determined as 100% as per lcr40

 some industry members are                 concerned about  potential asymmetrical treatment between                  two items with respect to unsettled sales and purchases as addressed in                 lcr40
93 faq1
 does this requirement apply broadly to all unsettled                 trades
 ie does it also apply to open and failed trades
 or does it                 only apply to forwards? banks which apply settlement date accounting                 for open trades would not have any open trades on ir balance                 sheet and refore this requirement might create an unlevel playing                 field for different accounting frameworks
                   unsettled transactions are addressed in  second to last paragraph of                  response to lcr40
93 faq1
 it refers to any sales or purchases                  are executed but not yet settled at reporting date and follows                  approach set out for forward transactions
 it captures both open and                 failed trades if settlement is expected within 30 days irrespective of                  balance sheet treatment
 in doing so
  response to lcr40
93                 faq1 allows for a symmetrical treatment by applying or cash                 outflows to executed but not yet settled purchases of non-hqla and
                 subject to national discretion
 or cash inflows to executed but not                 yet settled sales
" while unsettled sales/purchases of hqla can be                 ignored"
"         faq3      what is  treatment of level 1 and level 2 assets  are lent                 /borrowed without any furr offsetting transaction "
"ie no repo                 /reverse repo or collateral swap"
 if  assets will be returned or can be                 recalled during  next 30 days? are se assets eligible hqla on                  side of  lender or borrower?                   these assets do not count towards  stock of hqla for eir                  lender or  borrower
 on  side of  borrower
 se assets do not                         enter  lcr calculation
 on  lenders side
 se assets count                 towards  or contractual inflows amounting to ir market                 value  in  case of level 2 assets after haircut
         faq4      does lcr40
"93 faq3 apply to assets borrowed/lent on an unsecured                 basis only and not to secured transactions? is it correct to interpret                   basel committee means reused when it uses  wording furr                 offsetting transaction?                   lcr40"
"93 faq3 refers to assets borrowed/lent on an unsecured basis                 only"
" the wording without any furr offsetting transaction means                  absence of a corresponding transfer of cash or securities  would                 secure  securities borrowing/lending"
 such as in a repo
 reverse repo                 or collateral swap
 if  borrower has reused  securities
 re                 would be an or contractual cash outflow to cover unsecured                 collateral borrowings according to lcr40
74
                   the starting point and focus of lcr40
93 faq3 
as well as  response                 to it
 is  hqla eligibility of  assets on  part of eir                  borrower or  lender
 in this context
 it is assumed   borrower                 has not reused  assets as this would have made  question of                 hqla eligibility obsolete anyway
 the reuse of  collateral by                  borrower
 however
 introduces an outflow because  borrower may                 have to source se securities if  borrowing arrangement is not                 extended

      scope of application  10
4   the application of  nsfr requirement in this standard follows  scope of         application set out in sco10
 the nsfr must be applied to all internationally         active banks on a consolidated basis
 but may be used for or banks and on         any subset of entities of internationally active banks as well to ensure greater         consistency and a level playing field between domestic and cross-border banks
    10
5   regardless of  scope of application of  nsfr
 in line with principle 6 as         outlined in  principles for sound liquidity risk management and supervision
         a bank should actively monitor and control liquidity risk exposures and funding         needs at  level of individual legal entities
 foreign branches and subsidiaries
         and  group as a whole
 taking into account legal
 regulatory and operational         limitations to  transferability of liquidity
      exclusions from  nsfr calculation  10
6   a limited national discretion allows derivative transactions with central banks         arising from  latters short-term monetary policy and liquidity operations to be         excluded from  reporting banks nsfr computation and to offset unrealised         capital gains and losses related to se derivative transactions from available         stable funding
 these transactions include foreign exchange derivatives such as         foreign exchange swaps
 and must have a maturity of six months or less at         inception
 as such
  banks nsfr would not change due to entering a short
        term derivative transaction with its central bank for  purpose of short-term         monetary policy and liquidity operations

1   the net stable funding ratio 
nsfr
 requires banks to maintain a stable funding         profile in relation to  composition of ir assets and off-balance sheet         activities
 a sustainable funding structure is intended to reduce  likelihood          disruptions to a banks regular sources of funding will erode its liquidity position         in a way  would increase  risk of its failure and potentially lead to broader         systemic stress
 the nsfr limits overreliance on short-term wholesale funding
         encourages better assessment of funding risk across all on
and off-balance sheet         items
 and promotes funding stability
    20
2   the nsfr is defined as  amount of available stable funding relative to          amount of required stable funding
 this ratio should be equal to at least 100% on         an ongoing basis
 available stable funding is defined as  portion of capital         and liabilities expected to be reliable over  one-year time horizon considered         by  nsfr
 the amount of stable funding required 
"""required stable funding"""
         of an institution is a function of  liquidity characteristics and residual         maturities of  various assets held by  institution as well as those of its off
        balance sheet exposures
          20
3   the nsfr must be reported at least quarterly
 the time lag in reporting should         not surpass  allowable time lag under  basel capital standards
                                           nsf30                                   available and required stable                                   funding                                   this chapter describes how to calculate                                    amount of available stable funding provided by                                   a bank  liabilities and equity and how to                                   calculate  amount of required stable funding                                   for a bank  assets and off-balance-sheet                                   activities
                                       introduction  30
1   the amounts of available stable funding 
asf
 and required stable funding 
rsf
         specified in  standard are calibrated to reflect  presumed degree of stability         of liabilities and liquidity of assets
    30
2   the calibration reflects  stability of liabilities across two dimensions
           
1
 funding tenor
  net stable funding ratio 
nsfr
 is generally calibrated             such  longer-term liabilities are assumed to be more stable than short
            term liabilities
           
2
 funding type and counterparty
  nsfr is calibrated under  assumption              short-term 
maturing in less than one year
 deposits provided by retail             customers and funding provided by small business customers are             behaviourally more stable than wholesale funding of  same maturity from             or counterparties
    30
3   in determining  appropriate amounts of required stable funding for various         assets
  following criteria were taken into consideration
 recognising          potential trade-offs between se criteria
           
1
 resilient credit creation
  nsfr requires stable funding for some             proportion of lending to  real economy in order to ensure  continuity             of this type of intermediation
           
2
 bank behaviour
  nsfr is calibrated under  assumption  banks may             seek to roll over a significant proportion of maturing loans to preserve             customer relationships
           
3
 asset tenor
  nsfr assumes  some short-dated assets 
maturing in             less than one year
 require a smaller proportion of stable funding because             banks would be able to allow some proportion of those assets to mature             instead of rolling m over
           
4
 asset quality and liquidity value
  nsfr assumes  unencumbered
             high-quality assets  can be securitised or traded
 and thus can be readily             used as collateral to secure additional funding or sold in  market
 do not             need to be wholly financed with stable funding
    30
4   additional stable funding sources are also required to support at least a small         portion of  potential calls on liquidity arising from off-balance sheet         commitments and contingent funding obligations
    definition of available stable funding  30
5   the amount of asf is measured based on  broad characteristics of  relative         stability of an institutions funding sources
 including  contractual maturity of         its liabilities and  differences in  propensity of different types of funding         providers to withdraw ir funding
    30
6   the amount of asf must be calculated by first assigning  carrying value of an         institutions capital and liabilities to one of five categories as presented below
         the amount assigned to each category is n multiplied by an asf factor
 and          total asf is  sum of  weighted amounts
 carrying value represents          amount at which a liability or equity instrument is recorded before          application of any regulatory deductions
 filters or or adjustments
 as noted in         nsf10
2
 definitions mirror those outlined in  lcr standard
 unless orwise         specified
    30
7   when determining  maturity of an equity or liability instrument
  bank must         assume investors redeem call options at  earliest possible date
 for funding         with options exercisable at  banks discretion
 supervisors should take into         account reputational factors  may limit a banks ability not to exercise          option
 in particular
 where  market expects certain liabilities to be redeemed         before ir legal final maturity date
 banks and supervisors should assume such         behaviour for  purpose of  nsfr and include se liabilities in          corresponding asf category
 along  same lines
 when calculating  nsfr
         options by a bank to extend funding maturity of its obligations 
eg soft-bullet         structures
 should generally be assumed not to be exercised when re may be         reputational concerns
 for long-dated liabilities
 only  portion of cash flows         falling at or beyond  six-month and one-year time horizons should be treated         as having an effective residual maturity of six months or more and one year or         more
 respectively
  this could reflect a case where a bank may imply  it would be                     subject to funding risk if it did not exercise an option on its own                     funding
      30
8   derivative liabilities are calculated first based on  replacement cost for         derivative contracts 
obtained by marking to market
 where  contract has a         negative value
 when an eligible bilateral netting contract is in place  meets          conditions as specified in cre52
7
  replacement cost for  set of         derivative exposures covered by  contract must be  net replacement cost
            30
9         in calculating nsfr derivative liabilities
 collateral posted in  form of variation         margin in connection with derivative contracts
 regardless of  asset type
 must         be deducted from  negative replacement cost amount
      nsfr derivative liabilities = 
derivative liabilities
  
total collateral                     posted as variation margin on derivative liabilities
""
 to  extent                       banks accounting framework reflects on balance sheet
 in                     connection with a derivative contract
 an asset associated with                     collateral posted as variation margin  is deducted from                      replacement cost amount for purposes of  nsfr
  asset should                     not be included in  calculation of a banks rsf to avoid any double
                    counting

15 the amount of rsf is measured based on  broad characteristics of         liquidity risk profile of an institutions assets and off-balance-sheet exposures
        the amount of rsf is calculated by first assigning  carrying value of an        institutions assets to  categories listed below

 the amount assigned to each category is        n multiplied by its associated rsf factor

 in particular

 if re is a contractual provision with a review date at which  bank         may determine wher a given facility or loan is renewed or not
 supervisors may         authorise
 on a case by case basis
 banks to use  next review date as          maturity date
 in doing so
" supervisors must consider  incentives created and          actual likelihood  such facilities/loans will not be renewed"
 in particular
         options by a bank not to renew a given facility should generally be assumed not         to be exercised when re may be reputational concerns
    this could reflect a case where a bank may imply  it would be                     subject to funding risk if it did not exercise an option on its own assets
      30
18 in  case of exceptional central bank liquidity absorbing operations
 claims on        central banks may receive a reduced rsf factor
 for those operations with a        residual maturity equal to or greater than six months
  rsf factor must not be        lower than 5%
 when applying a reduced rsf factor
 supervisors need to closely        monitor  ongoing impact on banks stable funding positions arising from         reduced requirement and take appropriate measures as needed
 also
 as furr        specified in nsf30
20
 assets  are provided as collateral for exceptional central        bank liquidity providing operations may receive a reduced rsf factor which must        not be lower than  rsf factor applied to  equivalent asset  is        unencumbered

 where assets have less than six months remaining in  encumbrance        period
 those assets may receive  same rsf factor as an equivalent asset         is unencumbered
 in addition
 for  purposes of calculating  nsfr
 assets         are encumbered for exceptional central bank liquidity operations may        receive a reduced rsf factor
 supervisors should discuss and agree on         appropriate rsf factor with  relevant central bank
 which must not be lower        than  rsf factor applied to  equivalent asset  is unencumbered
       encumbered assets include but are not limited to assets backing                    securities or covered bonds and assets pledged in securities financing                    transactions or collateral swaps
 unencumbered is defined in lcr30

    in general
 exceptional central bank liquidity operations are considered                    to be non-standard
" temporary operations conducted by  central                    bank in order to achieve its mandate in a period of market-wide                    financial stress and/or exceptional macroeconomic challenges"
               faq       faq1      how should  encumbrance treatment be applied to secured lending                 
eg reverse repo
 transactions where  collateral received does not                 appear on  banks balance sheet
 and it has been rehypocated or                 sold reby creating a short position?                   the encumbrance treatment should be applied to  on-balance sheet                 receivable to  extent   transaction cannot mature without                  bank returning  collateral received to  counterparty
 as per                 lcr30
16
 for a transaction to be unencumbered
 it must be free of                 legal
 regulatory
 contractual or or restrictions on  ability of                  bank to liquidate
 sell
 transfer or assign  asset
 since                  liquidation of  cash receivable is contingent on  return of                 collateral  is no longer held by  bank
  receivable should be                 considered as encumbered
 when  collateral received from a                 secured funding transaction has been rehypocated
  receivable                 should be considered encumbered for  term of  rehypocation                 of  collateral
 when  collateral received from a secured funding                 transaction has been sold outright
 reby creating a short position
                  receivable related to  original secured funding transaction                 should be considered encumbered for  term of  residual maturity                 of this receivable
 thus
  on-balance-sheet receivable should
                   
be treated according to  answer to faq2 under nsf30
21 if                    remaining period of encumbrance is less than six months

20
         faq2      how should  encumbrance treatment be applied to secured lending                 
eg reverse repo
 transactions where  collateral appears on  bank                 s balance sheet
 and it has been rehypocated or sold
 reby                 creating a short position?                   collateral received  appears on a banks balance sheet and has                 been rehypocated 
eg encumbered to a repo
 should be treated as                 encumbered according to nsf30
20
 consequently
  collateral                 received should
                       
be treated as being unencumbered if  remaining period of                   encumbrance is less than six months according to nsf30

                   if  collateral has been sold outright
 reby creating a short                 position
  corresponding on-balance-sheet receivable should be                 considered encumbered for  term of  residual maturity of this                 receivable

 which may depend on  specific characteristics of                  covered bond issuance programme
 where collateral is posted for                  specific issuance of covered bonds and it is thus an intrinsic                 characteristic of a particular issuance
 n  excess collateral                 committed for  issuance cannot be used to raise additional funding                 or be taken out of  collateral pool without affecting                  characteristics of  issuance
 and must be considered encumbered for                 as long as it remains in  collateral pool
                   if
 however
  covered bonds are issued against a collateral pool                  allows for multiple issuance
 subject to supervisory discretion
                  excess collateral 
which would actually represent excess issuance                 capacity
 may be treated as unencumbered for  purpose of                  nsfr
 provided it can be withdrawn at  issuers discretion without                 any contractual
 regulatory
 reputational or relevant operational                 impediment 
such as a negative impact on  banks targeted rating
                 and it can be used to issue more covered bonds or mobilise such                 collateral in any or way 
eg by selling outright or securitising
""
 a                           type of operational impediment  should be taken into account                     includes those cases where rating agencies set an objective and                     measureable threshold for oc 
ie explicit oc requirements to maintain                     a minimum rating imposed by rating agencies

21 for secured funding arrangements
 use of balance sheet and accounting        treatments should generally result in banks excluding
 from ir assets
 securities        which y have borrowed in securities financing transactions 
such as reverse        repos and collateral swaps
 where y do not have beneficial ownership
 in        contrast
 banks must include securities y have lent in securities financing        transactions where y retain beneficial ownership
 banks should also not        include any securities y have received through collateral swaps if those        securities do not appear on ir balance sheets
 where banks have encumbered        securities in repos or or securities financing transactions
 but have retained        beneficial ownership and those assets remain on  banks balance sheet
         bank must allocate such securities to  appropriate rsf category
             faq         faq1        what is  treatment in terms of encumbrance for collateral pledged                     in a repo operation with remaining maturity of one year or greater but                     where  collateral pledged matures in less than one year?                       in this case
 for  purpose of computing  nsfr
  collateral                     should be considered encumbered for  term of  repo or secured                     transaction
 even if  actual maturity of  collateral is shorter than                     one year
 this follows because  collateral would have to be replaced                     once it matures
 thus
  collateral pledged under a transaction                     maturing beyond one year must be subject to a rsf factor of 100%
                     regardless of its maturity

  nsfr treatment of collateral received in a                     reverse repo is determined by  collaterals balance sheet and                     accounting treatments
 which should generally result in banks                     excluding from ir assets

 if
 however

        respectively
 the only exception is  securities financing transactions with a        single counterparty may be measured on a net basis when calculating  nsfr
        provided   netting conditions for securities financing transactions set out        in lev30 are met

 the requirement on frequency of calculation and                   exchange of margins states  variation margin is calculated and                   exchanged on a daily basis based on mark-to-market valuation of                   derivatives positions

    interdependent assets and liabilities  30

 supervisors may        adjust rsf and asf factors so  y are both 0%

1
 the individual interdependent asset and liability items must be clearly             identifiable
           
2
 the maturity and principal amount of both  liability and its             interdependent asset must be  same

 the bank is acting solely as a pass-through unit to channel  funding             received 
 interdependent liability
 into  corresponding interdependent             asset

 this standard                                   requires banks to measure ir exposures to a                                   single counterparty or a group of connected                                   counterparties and limit  size of large                                   exposures in relation to ir capital

                                       rationale and objectives of a large exposures framework  10
1   throughout history re have been instances of banks failing due to         concentrated exposures to individual counterparties or groups of connected         counterparties
 large exposures regulation has been developed as a tool for         limiting  maximum loss a bank could face in  event of a sudden         counterparty failure to a level  does not endanger  bank  solvency
    10
2   a large exposures framework complements  committee  risk-based capital         standard because  latter is not designed specifically to protect banks from         large losses resulting from  sudden default of a single counterparty or a group         of connected counterparties
 in particular
  minimum capital requirements         
pillar 1
 of  basel risk-based capital framework implicitly assume  a bank         holds infinitely granular portfolios
 ie no form of concentration risk is considered         in calculating capital requirements
 contrary to this assumption
 idiosyncratic risk         due to large exposures to individual counterparties or groups of connected         counterparties may be present in banks
portfolios
 although a supervisory review         process 
pillar 2
 concentration risk adjustment could be made to mitigate this         risk
 se adjustments are neir harmonised across jurisdictions
 nor designed         to protect a bank against very large losses from  default of a single         counterparty or a group of connected counterparties
 for this reason
  risk
        based capital framework is not sufficient to fully mitigate  microprudential risk         from exposures  are large compared to a bank  capital resources
 that         framework needs to be supplemented with a simple large exposures framework          protects banks from traumatic losses caused by  sudden default of an         individual counterparty or group of connected counterparties
 to serve as a         backstop to risk-based capital requirements
  large exposures framework         should be designed so   maximum possible loss a bank could incur if a         single counterparty or group of connected counterparties were to suddenly fail         would not endanger  bank  survival as a going concern
       the market risk standard mar also explicitly requires  trading book                     models for specific risk capture concentration risk
        10
3   the treatment of large exposures could also contribute to  stability of          financial system in a number of or ways
 for example
 material losses in one         systemically important financial institution 
sifi
 can trigger concerns about          solvency of or sifis
 with potentially catastrophic consequences for global         financial stability
 there are at least two important channels for this contagion
         first
 investors may be concerned  or sifis might have exposures similar to         those of  failing institution
 second
 and more directly
 investors may be         concerned  or sifis have direct large exposures to  failing sifi
 in          form of eir loans or credit guarantees
 the committee is of  view           large exposures framework is a useful tool to mitigate  risk of contagion         between global systemically important banks
 thus supporting global financial         stability
 as a second example
 this framework is also seen as a useful tool to         contribute to strengning  oversight and regulation of  shadow banking         system in relation to large exposures
 particularly  treatment of exposures to         funds
 securitisation structures and collective investment undertakings
      scope and level of application  10
4   the large exposures framework is constructed to serve as a backstop and         complement to  risk-based capital standards
 as a consequence
 it must apply         at  same level as  risk-based capital requirements are required to be         applied following sco10
 ie at every tier within a banking group
    10
5   the large exposures framework is applicable to all internationally active banks
 as         with all or standards issued by  committee
 member jurisdictions have          option to set more stringent standards
 they also have  option to extend          application to a wider range of banks
 with  possibility  if y deem it         necessary  to develop a different approach for banks  usually fall outside          scope of  basel framework
     for instance
  committee notes  for se banks  fall outside                      scope of application of  basel framework
 re may be a case                     for recognising physical collateral
 which is not recognised in  large                     exposures framework set out in this document
      10
6   the application of  large exposures framework at  consolidated level         implies  a bank must consider all exposures to third parties across          relevant regulatory consolidation group and compare  aggregate of those         exposures with  groups tier 1 capital
        scope of counterparties and exemptions  10
7   a bank must consider exposures to any counterparty

      definition of connected counterparties  10
9   in some cases
 a bank may have exposures to a group of counterparties with         specific relationships or dependencies such 
 were one of  counterparties         to fail
 all of  counterparties would very likely fail
 a group of this sort
 referred         to in this framework as a group of connected counterparties
 must be treated as a         single counterparty
 in this case
  sum of  banks exposures to all          individual entities included within a group of connected counterparties is subject         to  large exposure limit and to  regulatory reporting requirements as         specified in lex20

1
 voting agreements

3
 significant influence on senior management
 eg an entity has  power
              pursuant to a contract or orwise
 to exercise a controlling influence over               management or policies of anor entity 
eg through consent rights              over key decisions
""
    10
14 banks are also expected to refer to criteria specified in appropriate internationally        recognised accounting standards for furr qualitative guidance when        determining control
    10
15 where control has been established based on any of se criteria
 a bank may        still demonstrate to its supervisor in exceptional cases
 eg due to  existence of        specific circumstances and corporate governance safeguards
  such control        does not necessarily result in  entities concerned constituting a group of        connected counterparties
    10
16 in establishing connectedness based on economic interdependence
 banks must        consider
 at a minimum
  following qualitative criteria
            
1
 where 50% or more of one counterparty  gross receipts or gross              expenditures 
on an annual basis
 is derived from transactions with  or              counterparty 
"eg  owner of a residential/commercial property and               tenant who pays a significant part of  rent"
""
            
2
 where one counterparty has fully or partly guaranteed  exposure of               or counterparty
 or is liable by or means
 and  exposure is so              significant   guarantor is likely to default if a claim occurs
            
3
" where a significant part of one counterpartys production/output is sold to              anor counterparty"
 which cannot easily be replaced by or customers
                 
4
 when  expected source of funds to repay  loans of both             counterparties is  same and neir counterparty has anor             independent source of income from which  loan may be serviced and             fully repaid
           
5
 where it is likely   financial problems of one counterparty would             cause difficulties for  or counterparties in terms of full and timely             repayment of liabilities
           
6
 where  insolvency or default of one counterparty is likely to be associated             with  insolvency or default of  or
s
""
           
7
 when two or more counterparties rely on  same source for  majority             of ir funding and
 in  event of  common providers default
 an             alternative provider cannot be found  in this case
  funding problems of             one counterparty are likely to spread to anor due to a one-way or two
            way dependence on  same main funding source
    10
17 there may
 however
 be circumstances where some of se criteria do not        automatically imply an economic dependence  results in two or more        counterparties being connected
 provided   bank can demonstrate to its        supervisor  a counterparty which is economically closely related to anor        counterparty may overcome financial difficulties
 or even  second counterparty        s default
 by finding alternative business partners or funding sources within an        appropriate time period
  bank does not need to combine se        counterparties to form a group of connected counterparties
    10
18 there are cases where a thorough investigation of economic interdependencies        will not be proportionate to  size of  exposures
 therefore
 banks are        expected to identify possible connected counterparties on  basis of economic        interdependence in all cases where  sum of all exposures to one individual        counterparty exceeds 5% of tier 1 capital

 if  legal framework governing  regulation of             particular funds requires separation between  legal entity  manages              fund and  legal entity  has custody of  fund  assets
 in              case of structured finance products
  liquidity provider or sponsor of             short-term programmes 
asset-backed commercial paper conduits and             structured investment vehicles
 may warrant consideration as an additional             risk factor 
with  exposure value being  amount invested

 similarly
 in             syntic deals
  protection providers 
"sellers of protection by means of             cds/guarantees"
 may be an additional source of risk and a common factor             for interconnecting different structures 
in this case
  exposure value             would correspond to  percentage value of  underlying portfolio

 the second implication is  banks may add ir investments in a set of             structures associated with a third party  constitutes a common risk factor             to or exposures 
such as a loan
 it has to  third party
 wher              exposures to such structures must be added to any or exposures to              third party would again depend on a case-by-case consideration of              specific features of  structure and on  role of  third party
 in              example of  fund manager
 adding toger  exposures may not be             necessary because potentially fraudulent behaviour may not necessarily             affect  repayment of a loan
 the assessment may be different where              risk to  value of investments underlying  structures arises in  event             of a third-party default
 for example
 in  case of a credit protection             provider
  source of  additional risk for  bank investing in a             structure is  default of  credit protection provider
 the bank must add              investment in  structure to  direct exposures to  credit             protection provider since both exposures might crystallise into losses in              event   protection provider defaults 
ignoring  covered part of              exposures may lead to  undesirable situation of a high concentration risk             exposure to issuers of collateral or providers of credit protection

53 it is conceivable  a bank may consider multiple third parties to be potential        drivers of additional risk
 in this case
  bank must assign  exposure resulting        from  investment in  relevant structures to each of  third parties
    30
54 the requirement set out in lex30
48 to recognise a structural risk inherent in         structure instead of  risk stemming from  underlying exposures is        independent of whatever  general assessment of additional risks concludes

4   derivatives transactions between covered entities with zero counterparty risk         require zero initial margin and may be excluded from  initial margin         calculation

         suppose  one party
  option writer

 in this case
  option writer faces zero counterparty risk while  option         purchaser faces counterparty risk
 the option writer has received  full value of          option at  outset of  transaction
 the option purchaser
 on  or         hand
 faces counterparty risk since  option writer may not be willing or able to         sell shares to  option purchaser at  predetermined price at  expiry of            contract
 in this case
  option writer would not be obliged to collect any initial         margin from  option purchaser and  call option could be excluded from          initial margin calculation
 since  option purchaser faces counterparty risk
          option purchaser must collect initial margin from  option writer in a manner         consistent with  requirements of this standard

  requirement to apply  threshold on a fully consolidated basis        applies to both  counterparty to which  threshold is being extended and         counterparty  is extending  threshold
 as a specific example
 suppose         in  example above  firm 
as referenced above
 is itself organised into
        say
 three subsidiaries f1
 f2 and f3 and  each of se subsidiaries engages        in non-centrally cleared derivatives transactions with a1
 a2 and a3
 in this case
         extension of  50 million threshold by  firm to a1
 a2 and a3 is        considered across  entirety of  firm
 ie f1
 f2
 and f3
 so  all subsidiaries        of  firm extend in  aggregate no more than 50 million in an initial margin        threshold to all of a1
 a2 and a3
    10
12 the implementation of this approach requires appropriate cooperation between        home and host supervisors
 as  threshold is applied on a consolidated basis
        only  home supervisor of  consolidated group will necessarily be able to        verify   group does not exceed this threshold with all of its counterparties
        the host supervisors of subsidiaries of a group would not be able to assess        wher  local subsidiaries under ir responsibility comply with         threshold allocated by  group to each of its subsidiaries
 communication        between  home consolidated supervisors and host supervisors is refore        necessary to ensure   latter have access to information on  threshold        allocated to  local subsidiary under ir responsibility
      treatment of transactions with affiliates  10
13 transactions between a firm and its affiliates should be subject to appropriate        regulation in a manner consistent with each jurisdictions legal and regulatory        framework
 local supervisors should review ir own legal frameworks and        market conditions and put in place initial and variation margin requirements as        appropriate
        interaction of national regimes in cross-border transactions  10
14 regulatory regimes should interact so as to result in sufficiently consistent and        non-duplicative regulatory margin requirements for non-centrally cleared        derivatives across jurisdictions
    10
15 it is recommended  home and host country supervisors closely cooperate to        identify conflicts and inconsistencies between regimes with respect to cross
       border application of margin requirements
 it is furr recommended         authorities coordinate ir approaches via multilateral or bilateral channels to        reduce such issues
 to  extent possible
    10
16 the margin requirements in a jurisdiction may be applied to legal entities        established in  local jurisdiction
 which would include locally established        subsidiaries of foreign entities
 in relation to  initial and variation margins         y collect
 home-country supervisors may permit a covered entity to comply        with  margin requirements of a host-country margin regime with respect to its        derivatives activities
 provided   home-country supervisor considers         host-country margin regime to be consistent with  margin requirements        described in this framework
 a branch is part of  same legal entity as         headquarters
 it may be subject to eir  margin requirements of         jurisdiction where  headquarters is established or  requirements of  host        country

                                         introduction  20
1   margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives have two main benefits
           
1
 reduction of systemic risk
 only standardised derivatives are suitable for             central clearing
 a substantial fraction of derivatives are not standardised and             cannot be centrally cleared
 these non-centrally cleared derivatives
 totalling             hundreds of trillions of dollars in notional amounts
 pose  same type of             systemic contagion and spillover risks  materialised in  recent financial             crisis
 margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives would be             expected to reduce contagion and spillover effects by ensuring              collateral is available to offset losses caused by  default of a derivatives             counterparty
 margin requirements can also have broader macroprudential             benefits
 by reducing  financial systems vulnerability to potentially             destabilising procyclicality and limiting  build-up of uncollateralised             exposures within  financial system
           
2
 promotion of central clearing
 in many jurisdictions
 central clearing will be             mandatory for most standardised derivatives
 but clearing imposes costs
 in             part because central counterparties 
ccps
 require margin to be posted
             margin requirements on non-centrally cleared derivatives
 by reflecting              generally higher risk associated with se derivatives
 will promote central             clearing
 making  group of twentys original 2009 reform programme             more effective
 this could
 in turn
 contribute to  reduction of systemic             risk
    20
2   setting margin requirements at  international level is important
 to avoid         activity moving to locations with lower margin requirements
 such movement         would raise concerns about  effectiveness of  margin requirements 
eg         regulatory arbitrage
 or about financial institutions operating in low-margin         locations gaining a competitive advantage 
ie unlevel playing field

8   the methodologies for calculating initial and variation margin  serve as          baseline for margin collected from a counterparty should
           
1
 be consistent across entities covered by  requirements and reflect              potential future exposure 
initial margin
 and current exposure 
variation             margin
 associated with  particular portfolio of non-centrally cleared             derivatives at issue
 and           
2
 ensure  all counterparty risk exposures are covered fully with a high             degree of confidence
        baseline minimum amounts and methodologies for initial margin  20
9   for  purpose of informing  initial margin baseline
  potential future         exposure of a non-centrally cleared derivatives should reflect an extreme but         plausible estimate of an increase in  value of  instrument  is consistent         with a one-tailed 99 per cent confidence interval over a 10-day horizon
 based         on historical data  incorporates a period of significant financial stress
 the         initial margin amount must be calibrated to a period  includes financial stress         to ensure  sufficient margin will be available when it is most needed and to         limit  extent to which  margin can be procyclical
     the 10-day requirement should apply in  case  variation margin                     is exchanged daily
 if variation margin is exchanged at less than daily                     frequency n  minimum horizon should be set equal to 10 days                     plus  number of days in between variation margin exchanges
                      threshold calculation set out in mgn20
5 should noneless be made                     irrespective of  frequency with which variation margin is exchanged
          because of  discrete subset of transactions covered by  margin                     requirements
 se assumptions differ somewhat from                      assumptions used to calculate potential future exposure under                      basel regulatory capital framework for over--counter derivatives
      20
10 the required amount of initial margin may be calculated by reference to eir
           
1
 a quantitative portfolio margin model
 or           
2
 a standardised margin schedule
    20
11 when initial margin is calculated by reference to an initial margin model
         period of financial stress used for calibration should be identified and applied        separately for each broad asset class for which portfolio margining is allowed
 as        set out below
 in addition
  identified period must include a period of financial        stress and should cover a historical period not to exceed five years
 additionally
         data within  identified period should be equally weighted for calibration        purposes
      20
12 non-centrally cleared derivatives will often be exposed to a number of complex        and interrelated risks
 internal or third-party quantitative models  assess se        risks in a granular form can be useful for ensuring   relevant initial margin        amounts are calculated in an appropriately risk-sensitive manner
 moreover
           current practice among a number of large and active central counterparties is to         use internal quantitative models when determining initial margin amounts
    20
13 notwithstanding  utility of quantitative models
  use of such models is        predicated on  satisfaction of several prerequisite conditions
 these additional        requirements are intended to ensure   use of models does not lead to a        lowering of margin standards
 the use of models is also not intended to lower        margin standards  may already exist in  context of some non-centrally        cleared derivatives
 rar
  use of models is intended to produce        appropriately risk-sensitive assessments of potential future exposure so as to        promote robust margin requirements
           
1
 any quantitative model  is used for initial margin purposes must be             approved by  relevant supervisory authority
 models  have not been             granted explicit approval may not be used for initial margin purposes
             models may be eir internally developed or sourced from              counterparties or third-party vendors but in all such cases se models             must be approved by  appropriate supervisory authority
 moreover
 in              event  a third party-provided model is used for initial margin purposes
              model must be approved for use within each jurisdiction and by each             institution seeking to use  model
 similarly
 an unregulated counterparty              wishes to use a quantitative model for initial margin purposes may use             an approved initial margin model
" there will be no presumption              approval by one supervisor in  case of one or more institutions will imply             approval for a wider set of jurisdictions and/or institutions"
           
2
 quantitative initial margin models must be subject to an internal governance             process  continuously assesses  value of  models risk assessments
             tests  models assessments against realised data and experience
 and             validates  applicability of  model to  derivatives for which it is being             used
 the process must take into account  complexity of  products             covered 
eg barrier options and or more complex structures
""
    20
14 quantitative initial margin models may account for risk on a portfolio basis
 more        specifically
  initial margin model may consider all of  derivatives  are        approved for model use  are subject to a single legally enforceable netting        agreement
 derivatives between counterparties  are not subject to  same        legally enforceable netting agreement must not be considered in  same initial        margin model calculation
      20
15          derivative portfolios are often exposed to a number of offsetting risks  can          and should be reliably quantified for  purposes of calculating initial margin          requirements
 at  same time
 a distinction must be made between offsetting          risks  can be reliably quantified and those  are more difficult to quantify
          in particular
 inter-relationships between derivatives in distinct asset classes
 such          as equities and commodities
 are difficult to model and validate
 moreover
 this          type of relationship is prone to instability and may be more likely to break down          in a period of financial stress
 accordingly
 initial margin models may account for          diversification
" hedging and risk offsets within well defined asset classes such as          currency/rates"
  equity
 credit
 or commodities
 but not across such asset classes          and provided se instruments are covered by  same legally enforceable          netting agreement
 however
 any such incorporation of diversification
 hedging          and risk offsets by an initial margin model will require approval by  relevant          supervisory authority
 initial margin calculations for derivatives in distinct asset          classes must be performed without regard to derivatives in or asset classes
 as          a specific example
 for a derivatives portfolio consisting of a single credit          derivative and a single commodity derivative
 an initial margin calculation           uses an internal model would proceed by first calculating  initial margin          requirement on  credit derivatives and n calculating  initial margin          requirement on  commodity derivative
 the total initial margin requirement          for  portfolio would be  sum of  two individual initial margin amounts          because y are in two different asset classes 
commodities and credit
""
 finally
          derivatives for which a firm faces no 
ie zero
 counterparty risk require no initial          margin to be collected and may be excluded from  initial margin calculation
       currency and interest rate derivatives may be portfolio margined                      toger for  purposes of se requirements
 as an example
 an                      interest rate swap and a currency option may be margined on a                      portfolio basis as part of a single asset class
            inflation swaps
 which transfer inflation risk between counterparties
"                      may be considered as part of  currency/rates asset class for                       purpose of computing model-based initial margin requirements"
 and as                      part of  interest rate asset class for  purposes of computing                      standardised initial margin requirements
          20
16 while quantitative
 portfolio-based initial margin models can be a good risk        management tool if monitored and governed appropriately
 re are some        instances in which a simpler and less risk-sensitive approach to initial margin        calculations may be warranted
 in particular
 smaller market participants may not           wish or may be unable to develop and maintain a quantitative model and may be         unwilling to rely on counterpartys model
 in addition
 some market participants         may value simplicity and transparency in initial margin calculations
 without         resorting to a complex quantitative model
 furr
 an appropriately conservative         alternative for calculating initial margin is needed in  event  no approved         initial margin model exists to cover a specific transaction
 accordingly
  basel         committee and  international organization of securities commissions 
iosco
         have provided an initial margin schedule

17 the required initial margin will be computed by referencing  standardised        margin rates in mgn20
16 and by adjusting  gross initial margin amount by an        amount  relates to  net-to-gross ratio 
ngr
 pertaining to all derivatives in         legally enforceable netting set
 the use of  net-to-gross ratio is an        accepted practice in  context of bank capital regulation and recognises           important offsets  would not be recognised by strict application of a         standardised margin schedule
 the required initial margin amount would be         calculated in two steps
           
1
 first
  margin rate in  provided schedule would be multiplied by              gross notional size of  derivatives contract
 and n this calculation             would be repeated for each derivatives contract
           
2
 second
  gross initial margin amount is adjusted by  ratio of  net current  replace             cost to gross current replacement cost 
ngr
""
 the ngr is defined as  level of net  repla             cost over  level of gross replacement cost for transactions subject to legally  enforceabl             netting agreements
 the total amount of initial margin required on a portfolio according  t             standardised margin schedule would be  net standardised initial margin amount
 this  i             expressed through  following formula
       subject to approval by  relevant supervisory authority
 a limited                     degree of netting may be performed at  level of a specific                     derivatives contract to compute  notional amount  is applied to                      margin rate
 as an example
 one pay-fixed-interest-rate swap with                     a maturity of three years and a notional of 100 could be netted against                     anor pay-floating-interest-rate swap with a maturity of three years                     and a notional of 50 to arrive at a single notional of 50 to which                      appropriate margin rate would be applied
 derivatives with different                     fundamental characteristics such as underlying
 maturity and so forth                     may not be netted against each or for  purpose of computing                      notional amount against which  standardised margin rate is applied
      20
18 however
 if a regulated entity is already using a schedule-based margin to satisfy        requirements under its required capital regime
  appropriate supervisory        authority may permit  use of  same schedule for initial margin purposes
        provided  it is at least as conservative
            20
19                as in  case where firms use quantitative models to calculate initial margin
          derivatives for which a firm faces no 
ie zero
 counterparty risk require no initial          margin to be collected and may be excluded from  standardised initial margin          calculation
    20
20 derivatives market participants should not be allowed to switch between model
       and schedule
based margin calculations in an effort to cherry pick  most        favourable initial margin terms
 accordingly
  choice between model
and        schedule-based initial margin calculations should be made consistently over time        for all transactions within  same well defined asset class and
 if applicable
 it        should comply with any or requirements imposed by  entitys supervisory        authority
    20
21 at  same time
 it is quite possible  a market participant may use a model
       based initial margin calculation for one class of derivatives in which it commonly        deals and a schedule-based initial margin in  case of some derivatives  are        less routinely employed in its trading activities
 a firm need not restrict itself to a        model-based approach or to a schedule-based approach for  entirety of its        derivatives activities
 rar
 this requirement is meant to ensure  market        participants do not use model-based margin calculations in those instances in        which such calculations are more favourable than schedule-based requirements        and schedule-based margin calculations when those requirements are more        favourable than model-based margin requirements
    20
22 initial margin should be collected at  outset of a transaction
 and collected        reafter on a routine and consistent basis upon changes in measured potential        future exposure
 such as when trades are added to or subtracted from         portfolio
 to mitigate procyclicality impacts
 large discrete calls for 
additional
        initial margin due to cliff-edge triggers should be discouraged
    20
23 the build-up of additional initial margin should be gradual so  it can be        managed over time
 moreover
 margin levels should be sufficiently conservative
        even during periods of low market volatility
 to avoid procyclicality
 the specific        requirement  initial margin be set consistent with a period  includes stress        is meant to limit procyclical changes in  amount of initial margin required
          20
24 parties to derivatives contracts should have rigorous and robust dispute        resolution procedures in place with ir counterparty before  onset of a        transaction
 in particular
  amount of initial margin to be collected from one        party by anor will be  result of eir an approved model calculation or         standardised schedule
 the specific method and parameters  will be used by        each party to calculate initial margin should be agreed and recorded at  onset           of  transaction to reduce potential disputes
 moreover
 parties may agree to         use a single model for  purposes of such margin model calculations subject to         bilateral agreement and appropriate regulatory approval
 in  event  a         margin dispute arises
 both parties should make all necessary and appropriate         efforts
 including timely initiation of dispute resolution protocols
 to resolve          dispute and exchange  required amount of initial margin in a timely fashion
    20
25 the applicable netting agreements used by market participants will need to be        effective under  laws of  relevant jurisdictions and supported by        periodically updated legal opinions
 supervisory authorities and relevant market        participants should consider how those requirements could best be complied        with in practice

27 to reduce adverse liquidity shocks and in order to effectively mitigate        counterparty credit risk

28 the valuation of a derivatives current exposure can be complex and
 at times
        become subject to question or dispute by one or both parties
 in  case of non
       centrally cleared derivatives
 se instruments are likely to be relatively illiquid
        the associated lack of price transparency furr complicates  process of        agreeing on current exposure amounts for variation margin purposes
        accordingly
 parties to derivatives contracts should have rigorous and robust        dispute resolution procedures in place with ir counterparty before  onset of        a transaction
 in  event  a margin dispute arises
 both parties should make        all necessary and appropriate efforts

      eligible collateral for margin  20
29 to ensure  assets collected as collateral for initial and variation margin        purposes can be liquidated in a reasonable amount of time to generate proceeds         could sufficiently protect collecting entities covered by  requirements        from losses on non-centrally cleared derivatives in  event of a counterparty        default
 se assets should be highly liquid and should
 after accounting for an        appropriate haircut
 be able to hold ir value in a time of financial stress
 the        set of eligible collateral should take into account  assets which are liquid in        normal market conditions may rapidly become illiquid in times of financial stress
        in addition to having good liquidity
 eligible collateral should not be exposed to        excessive credit
 market and foreign exchange 
fx
 risk 
including through        differences between  currency of  collateral asset and  currency of        settlement
""
 to  extent   value of  collateral is exposed to se risks
        appropriately risk-sensitive haircuts should be applied
 more importantly
         value of  collateral should not exhibit a significant correlation with         creditworthiness of  counterparty or  value of  underlying non-centrally        cleared derivatives portfolio in such a way  would undermine         effectiveness of  protection offered by  margin collected 
ie  so-called        wrong way risk
""
 accordingly
 securities issued by  counterparty or its related        entities should not be accepted as collateral
 accepted collateral should also be        reasonably diversified
    20
30 national supervisors should develop ir own list of eligible collateral assets        based on  key principle
 taking into account  conditions of ir own        markets
 as a guide
 examples of  types of eligible collateral  satisfy         key principle would generally include
           
1
 cash
           
2
 high-quality government and central bank securities
           
3
 high-quality corporate bonds
           
4
 high-quality covered bonds
           
5
 equities included in major stock indices
 and           
6
 gold
          20
31 the illustrative list in mgn20
30 should not be viewed as being exhaustive
        additional assets and instruments  satisfy  key principle may also serve as        eligible collateral
 also
 in different jurisdictions
 some particular forms of        collateral may be more abundant or generally available due to institutional        market practices or norms
 eligible collateral can be denominated in any currency           in which payment obligations under  non-centrally cleared derivatives may be         made
 or in highly liquid foreign currencies subject to appropriate haircuts to         reflect  inherent fx risk involved
    20
32 haircut requirements should be transparent and easy to calculate
 so as to        facilitate payments between counterparties
 avoid disputes and reduce overall        operational risk
 haircut levels should be risk-based and should be calibrated        appropriately to reflect  underlying risks  affect  value of eligible        collateral
 such as market price volatility
 liquidity
 credit risk and fx volatility
        during both normal and stressed market conditions
 haircuts should be set        conservatively to avoid procyclicality
 for example
 haircuts should be set at a        sufficiently high level during good times to avoid  need for sharp and        sudden increases in times of stress
 potential methods for determining        appropriate haircuts could include eir internal or third-party quantitative        model-based haircuts or schedule-based haircuts
 each alternative is briefly        discussed below
    20
33 as in  case of initial margin models
 risk-sensitive quantitative models
 both        internal or third-party
 could be used to establish haircuts provided          model is approved by supervisors and is subject to appropriate internal        governance standards
 as in  case of initial margin models
 an unregulated        derivatives counterparty may use an approved quantitative model
 in addition to         points regarding  use of internal models discussed in  context of initial        margin
  basel committee and iosco also note  eligible collateral may        vary across national jurisdictions owing to differences in  availability and        liquidity of certain types of collateral
 as a result
 it may be difficult to establish a        standardised set of haircuts  would apply to all types of collateral across all        jurisdictions  are consistent with  key principle
        20
34 in addition to haircuts based on quantitative models
 as in  case of initial        margin
 derivatives counterparties should also have  option of using        standardised haircuts  would provide transparency and limit procyclical        effects
 the basel committee and iosco have established a standardised        schedule of haircuts for  list of assets appearing above
 the haircut levels are        derived from  standard supervisory haircuts adopted in  basel accords        comprehensive approach to collateralised transactions framework
 and can be        found in table 2
 in  event   basel committee chooses to make changes        to se haircuts for regulatory capital purposes
  basel committee and iosco        would expect to adopt se changes in  context of  margin requirements         for non-centrally cleared derivatives absent a compelling policy reason not to do         so
 however
 if a regulated entity is subject to an existing standardised haircut
        based approach under its required capital regime
  appropriate supervisory         authority may permit  use of  same haircuts for initial margin purposes
         provided  y are at least as conservative
 while haircuts serve a critical risk         management function in ensuring  pledged collateral is sufficient to cover         margin needs in a time of financial stress
 or risk mitigants should also be         considered when accepting non-cash collateral
 in particular
 entities covered by          requirements should ensure   collateral collected is not overly         concentrated in terms of an individual issuer

35 schedule-based haircuts should be stringent enough to give firms an incentive to        develop internal models
 to prevent firms from selectively applying         standardised tables where this would produce a lower haircut
" firms would have        to consistently adopt eir  standardised tables approach or  internal        /third-party models approach for all  collateral assets within  same well        defined asset class"
    20
36 in  event  a dispute arises over  value of eligible collateral
 both parties        should make all necessary and appropriate efforts
 including timely initiation of        dispute resolution protocols
 to resolve  dispute and exchange any required        margin in a timely fashion

      treatment of provided initial margin  20
38 because  exchange of initial margin on a net basis may be insufficient to        protect two market participants with large gross derivatives exposures to each        or in  case of one firms failure
  gross initial margin between such firms        should be exchanged
 initial margin collected should be held in such a way as to        ensure 
           
1
  margin collected is immediately available to  collecting party in              event of  counterpartys default

39 the collateral arrangements used will need to be effective under  relevant laws        and supported by periodically updated legal opinions
 jurisdictions are        encouraged to review  relevant local laws to ensure  collateral can be        sufficiently protected in  event of bankruptcy

                                      importance of supervisory review  10
1   the supervisory review process of  framework is intended not only to ensure          banks have adequate capital and liquidity to support all  risks in ir         business
 but also to encourage banks to develop and use better risk         management techniques in monitoring and managing ir risks
    10
2   the supervisory review process recognises  responsibility of bank         management in developing an internal capital assessment process and setting         capital targets  are commensurate with  banks risk profile and control         environment
 in  framework
 bank management continues to bear         responsibility for ensuring   bank has adequate capital to support its risks         beyond  core minimum requirements
    10
3   supervisors are expected to evaluate how well banks are assessing ir capital         needs relative to ir risks and to intervene
 where appropriate
 this interaction         is intended to foster an active dialogue between banks and supervisors such          when deficiencies are identified
 prompt and decisive action can be taken to         reduce risk or restore capital
 accordingly
 supervisors may wish to adopt an         approach to focus more intensely on those banks with risk profiles or operational         experience  warrants such attention
    10
4   the committee recognises  relationship  exists between  amount of         capital held by  bank against its risks and  strength and effectiveness of          banks risk management and internal control processes
 however
 increased         capital should not be viewed as  only option for addressing increased risks         confronting  bank
 or means for addressing risk
 such as strengning risk         management
 applying internal limits
 strengning  level of provisions and         reserves
 and improving internal controls
 must also be considered
 furrmore
         capital should not be regarded as a substitute for addressing fundamentally         inadequate control or risk management processes
    10
5   there are three main areas  might be particularly suited to treatment under         pillar 2
 risks considered under pillar 1  are not fully captured by  pillar 1         process 
eg credit concentration risk
""
 those factors not taken into account by          pillar 1 process 
eg interest rate risk in  banking book
 business and strategic         risk
""
 and factors external to  bank 
eg business cycle effects
""
 a furr         important aspect of pillar 2 is  assessment of compliance with  minimum         standards and disclosure requirements of  more advanced methods in pillar 1
         supervisors must ensure  se requirements are being met
 both as         qualifying criteria and on a continuing basis
         srp20                                   four key principles                                   the committee has identified four key principles                                   of supervisory review under pillar 2
 these                                   complement or supervisory guidance                                   published by  committee
 including  basel                                   core principles
                                       version effective as of                                   15 dec 2019                                   first version in  format of  consolidated                                   framework
          the four key principles  20
1   principle 1
 banks should have a process for assessing ir overall capital         adequacy in relation to ir risk profile and a strategy for maintaining ir         capital levels
    20
2   principle 2
 supervisors should review and evaluate banks internal capital         adequacy assessments and strategies
 as well as ir ability to monitor and         ensure ir compliance with regulatory capital ratios
 supervisors should take         appropriate supervisory action if y are not satisfied with  result of this         process
    20
3   principle 3
 supervisors should expect banks to operate above  minimum         regulatory capital ratios and should have  ability to require banks to hold         capital in excess of  minimum
    20
4   principle 4
 supervisors should seek to intervene at an early stage to prevent         capital from falling below  minimum levels required to support  risk         characteristics of a particular bank and should require rapid remedial action if         capital is not maintained or restored
      principle 1  banks process for assessing capital adequacy  20
5   banks must be able to demonstrate  chosen internal capital targets are well         founded and  se targets are consistent with ir overall risk profile and         current operating environment
 in assessing capital adequacy
 bank management         needs to be mindful of  particular stage of  business cycle in which          bank is operating
 rigorous
 forward-looking stress testing  identifies possible         events or changes in market conditions  could adversely impact  bank         should be performed
 bank management clearly bears primary responsibility for         ensuring   bank has adequate capital to support its risks
    20
6   the five main features of a rigorous process are as follows
           
1
 board and senior management oversight
           
2
 sound capital assessment
           
3
 comprehensive assessment of risks
           
4
 monitoring and reporting
 and           
5
 internal control review
           this chapter refers to a management structure composed of a board of                     directors and senior management
 the committee is aware  re                     are significant differences in legislative and regulatory frameworks                     across countries as regards  functions of  board of directors and                     senior management
 in some countries
  board has  main
 if not                     exclusive
 function of supervising  executive body 
senior                     management
 general management
 so as to ensure   latter                     fulfils its tasks
 for this reason
 in some cases
 it is known as a                     supervisory board
 this means   board has no executive                     functions
 in or countries
 by contrast
  board has a broader                     competence in  it lays down  general framework for                      management of  bank
 owing to se differences
  notions of                      board of directors and senior management are used in this section                     not to identify legal constructs but rar to label two decision-making                     functions within a bank
        board and senior management oversight    20
7   a sound risk management process is  foundation for an effective assessment         of  adequacy of a banks capital position
 bank management is responsible for         understanding  nature and level of risk being taken by  bank and how this         risk relates to adequate capital levels
 it is also responsible for ensuring           formality and sophistication of  risk management processes are appropriate in         light of  risk profile and business plan
    20
8   the analysis of a banks current and future capital requirements in relation to its         strategic objectives is a vital element of  strategic planning process
 the         strategic plan should clearly outline  banks capital needs
 anticipated capital         expenditures
 desirable capital level
 and external capital sources
 senior         management and  board should view capital planning as a crucial element in         being able to achieve its desired strategic objectives
    20
9   the banks board of directors has responsibility for setting  banks tolerance         for risks
 it should also ensure  management establishes a framework for         assessing  various risks
 develops a system to relate risk to  banks capital         level
 and establishes a method for monitoring compliance with internal policies
         it is likewise important   board of directors adopts and supports strong         internal controls and written policies and procedures and ensures          management effectively communicates se throughout  organisation
        sound capital assessment    20
10 fundamental elements of sound capital assessment include
           
1
 policies and procedures designed to ensure   bank identifies
             measures
 and reports all material risks
           
2
 a process  relates capital to  level of risk
           
3
 a process  states capital adequacy goals with respect to risk
 taking             account of  banks strategic focus and business plan
 and           
4
 a process of internal controls
 reviews and audit to ensure  integrity of              overall management process
      comprehensive assessment of risks    20
11 all material risks faced by  bank should be addressed in  capital assessment        process
 while  committee recognises  not all risks can be measured        precisely
 a process should be developed to estimate risks
 therefore
         following risk exposures
 which by no means constitute a comprehensive list of all        risks
 should be considered
    20
12 credit risk
 banks should have methodologies  enable m to assess         credit risk involved in exposures to individual borrowers or counterparties as well        as at  portfolio level
 banks should assess exposures
 regardless of wher        y are rated or unrated
 and determine wher  risk weights applied to        such exposures
 under  standardised approach
 are appropriate for ir        inherent risk
 in those instances where a bank determines   inherent risk of        such an exposure
 particularly if it is unrated
 is significantly higher than         implied by  risk weight to which it is assigned
  bank should consider         higher degree of credit risk in  evaluation of its overall capital adequacy
 for        more sophisticated banks
  credit review assessment of capital adequacy
 at a        minimum
 should cover four areas
           
1
 risk-rating systems
           
2
" portfolio analysis / aggregation"
           
3
" securitisation / complex credit derivatives"
 and           
4
 large exposures and risk concentrations
          20
13 internal risk ratings are an important tool in monitoring credit risk
 internal risk        ratings should be adequate to support  identification and measurement of risk           from all credit exposures
 and should be integrated into an institutions overall         analysis of credit risk and capital adequacy
 the ratings system should provide         detailed ratings for all assets
 not only for criticised or problem assets
 loan loss         reserves should be included in  credit risk assessment for capital adequacy
    20
14 the analysis of credit risk should adequately identify any weaknesses at         portfolio level
 including any concentrations of risk
 it should also adequately take        into consideration  risks involved in managing credit concentrations and or        portfolio issues through such mechanisms as securitisation programmes and        complex credit derivatives
 furr
  analysis of counterparty credit risk should        include consideration of public evaluation of  supervisors compliance with         core principles for effective banking supervision

15 operational risk
  committee believes  similar rigour should be applied to         management of operational risk
 as is done for  management of or        significant banking risks
" the failure to properly manage operational risk can        result in a misstatement of an institutions risk/return profile and expose         institution to significant losses"
    20
16 a bank should develop a framework for managing operational risk and evaluate         adequacy of capital given this framework
 the framework should cover         banks appetite and tolerance for operational risk
 as specified through         policies for managing this risk
 including  extent and manner in which        operational risk is transferred outside  bank
 it should also include policies        outlining  banks approach to identifying
 assessing
" monitoring and        controlling/mitigating  risk"
    20
17 market risk
 banks should have methodologies  enable m to assess and        actively manage all material market risks
 wherever y arise
 at position
 desk
        business line and firm-wide level
 for more sophisticated banks
 ir assessment        of internal capital adequacy for market risk
 at a minimum
 should be based on        both value-at-risk 
var
 modelling and stress testing
 including an assessment of        concentration risk and  assessment of illiquidity under stressful market        scenarios
 although all firms assessments should include stress testing        appropriate to ir trading activity
      20
18 var is an important tool in monitoring aggregate market risk exposures and        provides a common metric for comparing  risk being run by different desks        and business lines
 a banks var model should be adequate to identify and        measure risks arising from all its trading activities and should be integrated into         banks overall internal capital assessment as well as subject to rigorous on
       going validation
 a var model estimates should be sensitive to changes in         trading book risk profile
    20
19 banks must supplement ir var model with stress tests 
factor shocks or        integrated scenarios wher historic or hypotical
 and or appropriate risk        management techniques
 in  banks internal capital assessment it must        demonstrate  it has enough capital to not only meet  minimum capital        requirements but also to withstand a range of severe but plausible market        shocks
 in particular
 it must factor in
 where appropriate
           
1
" illiquidity / gapping of prices"
           
2
 concentrated positions 
in relation to market turnover
""
           
3
 one-way markets
           
4
" non-linear products / deep out-of--money positions"
           
5
 events and jumps-to-default
           
6
 significant shifts in correlations
 and           
7
 or risks  may not be appropriately captured in var 
eg recovery rate             uncertainty
 implied correlations or skew risk
""
    20
20 the stress tests applied by a bank and
 in particular
  calibration of those tests        
""
  parameters of  shocks or types of events considered
 should be        reconciled back to a clear statement setting out  premise upon which  bank        s internal capital assessment is based 
eg ensuring re is adequate capital to        manage  traded portfolios within stated limits through what may be a        prolonged period of market stress and illiquidity
 or  re is adequate capital        to ensure 
 over a given time horizon to a specified confidence level
 all        positions can be liquidated or  risk hedged in an orderly fashion
""
 the market        shocks applied in  tests must reflect  nature of portfolios and  time it        could take to hedge out or manage risks under severe market conditions
    20
21 concentration risk should be pro-actively managed and assessed by firms and        concentrated positions should be routinely reported to senior management
        20
22 banks should design ir risk management systems
 including  var        methodology and stress tests
 to properly measure  material risks in        instruments y trade as well as  trading strategies y pursue
 as ir         instruments and trading strategies change
  var methodologies and stress         tests should also evolve to accommodate  changes
    20
23 banks must demonstrate how y combine ir risk measurement approaches        to arrive at  overall internal capital for market risk
    20
24 interest rate risk in  banking book
  measurement process should include        all material interest rate positions of  bank and consider all relevant repricing        and maturity data
 such information will generally include current balance and        contractual rate of interest associated with  instruments and portfolios
        principal payments
 interest reset dates
 maturities
  rate index used for        repricing
 and contractual interest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable-rate items
        the system should also have well-documented assumptions and techniques
    20
25 regardless of  type and level of complexity of  measurement system used
        bank management should ensure  adequacy and completeness of  system
        because  quality and reliability of  measurement system is largely        dependent on  quality of  data and various assumptions used in  model
        management should give particular attention to se items
    20
26 liquidity risk
 liquidity is crucial to  ongoing viability of any banking        organisation
 banks capital positions can have an effect on ir ability to obtain        liquidity
 especially in a crisis
 each bank must have adequate systems for        measuring
 monitoring and controlling liquidity risk
 banks should evaluate         adequacy of capital given ir own liquidity profile and  liquidity of         markets in which y operate
    20
27 or risks
 although  committee recognises  or risks
 such as        reputational and strategic risk
 are not easily measurable
 it expects industry to        furr develop techniques for managing all aspects of se risks
      monitoring and reporting    20
28 the bank should establish an adequate system for monitoring and reporting risk        exposures and assessing how  banks changing risk profile affects  need for        capital
 the banks senior management or board of directors should
 on a regular        basis
 receive reports on  banks risk profile and capital needs
 these reports        should allow senior management to
           
1
 evaluate  level and trend of material risks and ir effect on capital levels
             
2
 evaluate  sensitivity and reasonableness of key assumptions used in              capital assessment measurement system
           
3
 determine   bank holds sufficient capital against  various risks and             is in compliance with established capital adequacy goals
 and           
4
 assess its future capital requirements based on  banks reported risk             profile and make necessary adjustments to  banks strategic plan             accordingly
      internal control review    20
29 the banks internal control structure is essential to  capital assessment        process
 effective control of  capital assessment process includes an        independent review and
 where appropriate
  involvement of internal or        external audits
 the banks board of directors has a responsibility to ensure         management establishes a system for assessing  various risks
 develops a        system to relate risk to  banks capital level
 and establishes a method for        monitoring compliance with internal policies
 the board should regularly verify        wher its system of internal controls is adequate to ensure well-ordered and        prudent conduct of business
    20
30 the bank should conduct periodic reviews of its risk management process to        ensure its integrity
 accuracy
 and reasonableness
 areas  should be reviewed        include
           
1
 appropriateness of  banks capital assessment process given  nature
             scope and complexity of its activities
           
2
 identification of large exposures and risk concentrations
           
3
 accuracy and completeness of data inputs into  banks assessment             process
           
4
 reasonableness and validity of scenarios used in  assessment process
 and           
5
 stress testing and analysis of assumptions and inputs
          principle 2  supervisory review of banks internal capital adequacy  assessments  20
31 the supervisory authorities should regularly review  process by which a bank        assesses its capital adequacy
 risk position
 resulting capital levels
 and quality of        capital held
 supervisors should also evaluate  degree to which a bank has in        place a sound internal process to assess capital adequacy
 the emphasis of         review should be on  quality of  banks risk management and controls and        should not result in supervisors functioning as bank management
 the periodic        review can involve some combination of
           
1
 on-site examinations or inspections
           
2
 off-site review
           
3
 discussions with bank management
           
4
 review of work done by external auditors 
provided it is adequately focused             on  necessary capital issues
""
 and           
5
 periodic reporting
    20
32 the substantial impact  errors in  methodology or assumptions of formal        analyses can have on resulting capital requirements requires a detailed review by        supervisors of each banks internal analysis
    20
33 supervisors should assess  degree to which internal targets and processes        incorporate  full range of material risks faced by  bank
 supervisors should        also review  adequacy of risk measures used in assessing internal capital        adequacy and  extent to which se risk measures are also used operationally        in setting limits
 evaluating business line performance
 and evaluating and        controlling risks more generally
 supervisors should consider  results of        sensitivity analyses and stress tests conducted by  institution and how se        results relate to capital plans
    20
34 supervisors should review  banks processes to determine 
           
1
 target levels of capital chosen are comprehensive and relevant to  current             operating environment
           
2
 se levels are properly monitored and reviewed by senior management
             and           
3
  composition of capital is appropriate for  nature and scale of  bank             s business
          20
35 supervisors should also consider  extent to which  bank has provided for        unexpected events in setting its capital levels
 this analysis should cover a wide        range of external conditions and scenarios
 and  sophistication of techniques        and stress tests used should be commensurate with  banks activities
    20
36 supervisors should consider  quality of  banks management information        reporting and systems
  manner in which business risks and activities are        aggregated
 and managements record in responding to emerging or changing        risks
    20
37 in all instances
  capital level at an individual bank should be determined        according to  banks risk profile and adequacy of its risk management process        and internal controls
 external factors such as business cycle effects and         macroeconomic environment should also be considered
    20
38 in order for certain internal methodologies
 credit risk mitigation techniques and        asset securitisations to be recognised for regulatory capital purposes
 banks will        need to meet a number of requirements
 including risk management standards        and disclosures
 in particular
 banks will be required to disclose features of ir        internal methodologies used in calculating minimum capital requirements
 as        part of  supervisory review process
 supervisors must ensure  se        conditions are being met on an ongoing basis
    20
39 the committee regards this review of minimum standards and qualifying criteria        as an integral part of  supervisory review process under principle 2
 in setting         minimum criteria  committee has considered current industry practice and        so anticipates  se minimum standards will provide supervisors with a        useful set of benchmarks  are aligned with bank management expectations        for effective risk management and capital allocation
    20
40 there is also an important role for supervisory review of compliance with certain        conditions and requirements set for standardised approaches
 in this context
        re will be a particular need to ensure  use of various instruments  can        reduce pillar 1 capital requirements are utilised and understood as part of a        sound

 and properly documented risk management process

 supervisors should take        appropriate action if y are not satisfied with  results of  banks own risk        assessment and capital allocation
 supervisors should consider a range of actions
        such as those set out under principles 3 and 4 below
        principle 3  banks should operate above minimum regulatory capital  ratios  20
42 pillar 1 capital requirements will include a buffer for uncertainties surrounding         pillar 1 regime  affect  banking population as a whole
 bank-specific        uncertainties will be treated under pillar 2
 it is anticipated  such buffers        under pillar 1 will be set to provide reasonable assurance  a bank with good        internal systems and controls
 a well-diversified risk profile and a business profile        well covered by  pillar 1 regime
 and which operates with capital equal to pillar        1 requirements
 will meet  minimum goals for soundness embodied in pillar 1
        however
 supervisors will need to consider wher  particular features of         markets for which y are responsible are adequately covered
 supervisors will        typically require 
or encourage
 banks to operate with a buffer
 over and above         pillar 1 standard
 banks should maintain this buffer for a combination of         following
           
1
 pillar 1 minimums are anticipated to be set to achieve a level of bank             creditworthiness in markets  is below  level of creditworthiness             sought by many banks for ir own reasons
 for example
 most             international banks appear to prefer to be highly rated by internationally             recognised rating agencies
 thus
 banks are likely to choose to operate             above pillar 1 minimums for competitive reasons
           
2
 in  normal course of business
  type and volume of activities will             change
 as will  different risk exposures
 causing fluctuations in  overall             capital ratio
           
3
 it may be costly for banks to raise additional capital
 especially if this needs             to be done quickly or at a time when market conditions are unfavourable
           
4
 for banks to fall below minimum regulatory capital requirements is a serious             matter
" it may place banks in breach of  relevant law and/or prompt non"
            discretionary corrective action on  part of supervisors
           
5
 there may be risks
 eir specific to individual banks
 or more generally to             an economy at large
  are not taken into account in pillar 1
    20
43 there are several means available to supervisors for ensuring  individual        banks are operating with adequate levels of capital
 among or methods
         supervisor may set trigger and target capital ratios or define categories above        minimum ratios 
eg well capitalised and adequately capitalised
 for identifying         capitalisation level of  bank
        principle 4  early supervisory intervention  20
44 supervisors should consider a range of options if y become concerned  a        bank is not meeting  requirements embodied in  supervisory principles        outlined above
 these actions may include intensifying  monitoring of         bank
 restricting  payment of dividends
 requiring  bank to prepare and        implement a satisfactory capital adequacy restoration plan
 and requiring         bank to raise additional capital immediately
 supervisors should have         discretion to use  tools best suited to  circumstances of  bank and its        operating environment
    20
45 the permanent solution to banks difficulties is not always increased capital
        however
 some of  required measures 
such as improving systems and        controls
 may take a period of time to implement
 therefore
 increased capital        might be used as an interim measure while permanent measures to improve         banks position are being put in place
 once se permanent measures have        been put in place and have been seen by supervisors to be effective
  interim        increase in capital requirements can be removed

                                            introduction  30
1   sound risk management processes are necessary to support supervisory and         market participants confidence in banks assessments of ir risk profiles and         internal capital adequacy assessments
 these processes take on particular         importance in light of  identification
 measurement and aggregation         challenges arising from increasingly complex on
and off-balance sheet         exposures
    30
2   when assessing wher a bank is appropriately capitalised
 bank management         should ensure  it properly identifies and measures  risks to which  bank         is exposed
 a financial institutions internal capital adequacy assessment process         
icaap
 should be conducted on a consolidated basis and
 when deemed         necessary by  appropriate supervisors
 at  legal entity level for each bank in          group
 in addition
  icaap should incorporate stress testing to         complement and help validate or quantitative and qualitative approaches so          bank management may have a more complete understanding of  banks         risks and  interaction of those risks under stressed conditions
 a bank should         also perform a careful analysis of its capital instruments and ir potential         performance during times of stress
 including ir ability to absorb losses and         support ongoing business operations
 a banks icaap should address both short
        and long-term needs and consider  prudence of building excess capital over         benign periods of  credit cycle and also to withstand a severe and prolonged         market downturn
 differences between  capital assessment under a banks         icaap and  supervisory assessment of capital adequacy made under pillar 2         should trigger a dialogue  is proportionate to  depth and nature of such         differences
        the icaap is a bank-driven process  should leverage off an                     institutions internal risk management processes
 a single icaap may                     be used for internal and regulatory purposes
        30
3   pillar 1 capital requirements represent minimum requirements
 all of a banks         risks  both on
and off-balance sheet
 and particularly those risks related to         complex capital market activities  should be adequately covered by capital
         including through pillar 2 in excess of minimum pillar 1 requirements
 this will         help ensure  a bank maintains sufficient capital for risks not adequately         addressed through pillar 1 and  it will be able to operate effectively         throughout a severe and prolonged period of financial market stress or an         adverse credit cycle
 this should
 in part
 include drawing down on  capital         buffer built-up during good times
 while all banks must comply with          minimum capital requirements during and after such stress events
 it is         imperative  systemically important banks have  shock absorption         capability to adequately protect against severe stress events
    30
4   the detail and sophistication of a banks risk management programmes should         be commensurate with  size and complexity of its business and  overall         level of risk   bank accepts
 this guidance
 refore
 should be applied to         banks on a proportionate basis
    30
5   supervisors should determine wher a bank has in place a sound firm-wide risk         management framework  enables it to define its risk appetite and recognise         all material risks
 including  risks posed by concentrations
 securitisation
 off
        balance sheet exposures
 valuation practices and or risk exposures
 the bank         can achieve this by
           
1
 adequately identifying
 measuring
 monitoring
 controlling and mitigating             se risks
           
2
 clearly communicating  extent and depth of se risks in an easily             understandable
 but accurate
 manner in reports to senior management and              board of directors
 as well as in published financial reports
           
3
 conducting ongoing stress testing to identify potential losses and liquidity             needs under adverse circumstances
 and           
4
 setting adequate minimum internal standards for allowances or liabilities for             losses
 capital
 and contingency funding
    30
6   these elements should be adequately incorporated into a banks risk         management system and icaap specifically since y are not fully captured by         pillar 1 of  basel iii framework
      firm-wide risk oversight  30
7   a sound risk management system should have  following key features
                 
1
 active board and senior management oversight
           
2
 appropriate policies
 procedures and limits
           
3
 comprehensive and timely identification
 measurement
 mitigation
             controlling
 monitoring and reporting of risks
           
4
 appropriate management information systems 
mis
 at  business and             firm-wide level
 and           
5
 comprehensive internal controls
    30
8   it is  responsibility of  board of directors and senior management to         define  institutions risk appetite and to ensure   banks risk         management framework includes detailed policies  set specific firm-wide         prudential limits on  banks activities
 which are consistent with its risk taking         appetite and capacity
 in order to determine  overall risk appetite
  board         and senior management must first have an understanding of risk exposures on a         firm-wide basis
 to achieve this understanding
  appropriate members of         senior management must bring toger  perspectives of  key business         and control functions
 in order to develop an integrated firm-wide perspective on         risk
 senior management must overcome organisational silos between business         lines and share information on market developments
 risks and risk mitigation         techniques
 as  banking industry has moved increasingly towards market
        based intermediation
 re is a greater probability  many areas of a bank         may be exposed to a common set of products
 risk factors or counterparties
         senior management should establish a risk management process  is not         limited to credit
 market
 liquidity and operational risks
 but incorporates all         material risks
 this includes reputational
 legal and strategic risks
 as well as risks          do not appear to be significant in isolation
 but when combined with or         risks could lead to material losses
           this refers to a management structure composed of a board of                     directors and senior management
 the committee is aware  re                     are significant differences in legislative and regulatory frameworks                     across countries as regards  functions of  board of directors and                     senior management
 in some countries
  board has  main
 if not                     exclusive
 function of supervising  executive body 
senior                     management
 general management
 so as to ensure   latter                     fulfils its tasks
 for this reason
 in some cases
 it is known as a                     supervisory board
 this means   board has no executive                     functions
 in or countries
 by contrast
  board has a broader                     competence in  it lays down  general framework for                      management of  bank
 owing to se differences
  notions of                      board of directors and senior management are used in this paper                     not to identify legal constructs but rar to label two decision-making                     functions within a bank
      30
9   the board of directors and senior management should possess sufficient         knowledge of all major business lines to ensure  appropriate policies
 controls         and risk monitoring systems are effective
 they should have  necessary         expertise to understand  capital markets activities in which  bank is         involved  such as securitisation and off-balance sheet activities  and          associated risks
 the board and senior management should remain informed on         an on-going basis about se risks as financial markets
 risk management         practices and  banks activities evolve
 in addition
  board and senior         management should ensure  accountability and lines of authority are clearly         delineated
 with respect to new or complex products and activities
 senior         management should understand  underlying assumptions regarding business         models
 valuation and risk management practices
 in addition
 senior         management should evaluate  potential risk exposure if those assumptions fail
    30
10 before embarking on new activities or introducing products new to         institution
  board and senior management should identify and review         changes in firm-wide risks arising from se potential new products or activities        and ensure   infrastructure and internal controls necessary to manage         related risks are in place
 in this review
 a bank should also consider  possible        difficulty in valuing  new products and how y might perform in a stressed        economic environment
          30
11 a banks risk function and its chief risk officer or equivalent position should be        independent of  individual business lines and report directly to  chief        executive officer and  institutions board of directors
 in addition
  risk        function should highlight to senior management and  board risk management        concerns
 such as risk concentrations and violations of risk appetite limits
    30
12 firm-wide risk management programmes should include detailed policies  set        specific firm-wide prudential limits on  principal risks relevant to a banks        activities
 a banks policies and procedures should provide specific guidance for         implementation of broad business strategies and should establish
 where        appropriate
 internal limits for  various types of risk to which  bank may be        exposed
 these limits should consider  banks role in  financial system and        be defined in relation to  banks capital
 total assets
 earnings or
 where        adequate measures exist
 its overall risk level
    30
13 a banks policies
 procedures and limits should
           
1
 provide for adequate and timely identification

 including             reputational risk and valuation uncertainty
 are fully recognised and             incorporated into  banks risk management processes
           
3
 be consistent with  banks stated goals and objectives
 as well as its             overall financial strength
           
4
 clearly delineate accountability and lines of authority across  banks             various business activities
 and ensure re is a clear separation between             business lines and  risk function
           
5
 escalate and address breaches of internal position limits
           
6
 provide for  review of new businesses and products by bringing toger             all relevant risk management
 control and business lines to ensure               bank is able to manage and control  activity prior to it being initiated
 and           
7
 include a schedule and process for reviewing  policies
 procedures and             limits and for updating m as appropriate
            30
14 a banks mis should provide  board and senior management in a clear and        concise manner with timely and relevant information concerning ir        institutions risk profile
 this information should include all risk exposures
        including those  are off-balance sheet
 management should understand         assumptions behind and limitations inherent in specific risk measures
    30
15 the key elements necessary for  aggregation of risks are an appropriate        infrastructure and mis 
           
1
 allow for  aggregation of exposures and risk measures across business             lines and           
2
 support customised identification of concentrations

16 a banks mis should be capable of capturing limit breaches and re should be        procedures in place to promptly report such breaches to senior management
 as        well as to ensure  appropriate follow-up actions are taken
 for instance
        similar exposures should be aggregated across business platforms 
including         banking and trading books
 to determine wher re is a concentration or a        breach of an internal position limit
    30
17 mis developed to achieve this objective should support  ability to evaluate         impact of various types of economic and financial shocks  affect  whole of         financial institution
 furr
 a banks systems should be flexible enough to        incorporate hedging and or risk mitigation actions to be carried out on a firm
       wide basis while taking into account  various related basis risks
    30
18 to enable proactive management of risk
  board and senior management        need to ensure  mis is capable of providing regular
 accurate and timely        information on  banks aggregate risk profile
 as well as  main assumptions        used for risk aggregation
 mis should be adaptable and responsive to changes in         banks underlying risk assumptions and should incorporate multiple        perspectives of risk exposure to account for uncertainties in risk measurement
 in        addition
 it should be sufficiently flexible so   institution can generate        forward-looking bank-wide scenario analyses  capture managements        interpretation of evolving market conditions and stressed conditions

 third-party inputs or or tools used within        mis 
eg credit ratings
 risk measures
 models
 should be subject to initial and        ongoing validation
          30
19 risk management processes should be frequently monitored and tested by        independent control areas and internal
 as well as external
 auditors
 the aim is        to ensure   information on which decisions are based is accurate so         processes fully reflect management policies and  regular reporting
 including         reporting of limit breaches and or exception-based reporting
 is         undertaken effectively
 the risk management function of banks must be         independent of  business lines in order to ensure an adequate separation of         duties and to avoid conflicts of interest

        risk concentration  30
20 unmanaged risk concentrations are an important cause of major problems in        banks
 a bank should aggregate all similar direct and indirect exposures        regardless of where  exposures have been booked
 a risk concentration is any        single exposure or group of similar exposures 
eg to  same borrower or        counterparty
 including protection providers
 geographic area
 industry or or        risk factors
 with  potential to produce 
i
 losses large enough 
relative to a        banks earnings
 capital
 total assets or overall risk level
 to threaten a banks        creditworthiness or ability to maintain its core operations or 
ii
 a material change        in a banks risk profile
 risk concentrations should be analysed on both a bank        legal entity and consolidated basis
 as an unmanaged concentration at a        subsidiary bank may appear immaterial at  consolidated level
 but can        noneless threaten  viability of  subsidiary organisation
    30
21 risk concentrations should be viewed in  context of a single or a set of closely        related risk-drivers  may have different impacts on a bank
 these        concentrations should be integrated when assessing a banks overall risk        exposure
 a bank should consider concentrations  are based on common or        correlated risk factors  reflect more subtle or more situation-specific factors        than traditional concentrations
 such as correlations between market
 credit risks        and liquidity risk
          30
22 the growth of market-based intermediation has increased  possibility         different areas of a bank are exposed to a common set of products
 risk factors or        counterparties
 this has created new challenges for risk aggregation and        concentration management
 through its risk management processes and mis
 a        bank should be able to identify and aggregate similar risk exposures across         firm
 including across legal entities
 asset types 
eg loans
 derivatives and         structured products
""
 risk areas 
eg  trading book
 and geographic regions
         the typical situations in which risk concentrations can arise include
           
1
 exposures to a single counterparty
 borrower or group of connected             counterparties or borrowers
           
2
 industry or economic sectors
 including exposures to both regulated and             nonregulated financial institutions such as hedge funds and private equity             firms
           
3
 geographical regions
           
4
 exposures arising from credit risk mitigation techniques

             derivatives and structured products
 and           
9
 off-balance sheet exposures
 including guarantees
 liquidity lines and or             commitments
    30
23 risk concentrations can also arise through a combination of exposures across        se broad categories
 a bank should have an understanding of its firm-wide        risk concentrations resulting from similar exposures across its different business        lines
 examples of such business lines include subprime exposure in lending        books
 counterparty exposures
 conduit exposures and structured investment        vehicles 
sivs
""
 contractual and non-contractual exposures
 trading activities
 and        underwriting pipelines
          30
24 while risk concentrations often arise due to direct exposures to borrowers and        obligors
 a bank may also incur a concentration to a particular asset type           indirectly through investments backed by such assets 
eg collateralised debt         obligations
""
 as well as exposure to protection providers guaranteeing          performance of  specific asset type 
eg monoline insurers
""
 a bank should         have in place adequate
 systematic procedures for identifying high correlation         between  creditworthiness of a protection provider and  obligors of          underlying exposures due to ir performance being dependent on common         factors beyond systematic risk 
ie wrong way risk
""
    30
25 procedures should be in place to communicate risk concentrations to  board        of directors and senior management in a manner  clearly indicates where in         organisation each segment of a risk concentration resides
 a bank should        have credible risk mitigation strategies in place  have senior management        approval
 this may include altering business strategies
 reducing limits or        increasing capital buffers in line with  desired risk profile
 while it implements        risk mitigation strategies
  bank should be aware of possible concentrations         might arise as a result of employing risk mitigation techniques
    30
26 banks should employ a number of techniques
 as appropriate
 to measure risk        concentrations
 these techniques include shocks to various risk factors
 use of        business level and firm-wide scenarios
 and  use of integrated stress testing        and economic capital models
 identified concentrations should be measured in a        number of ways
 including for example consideration of gross versus net        exposures
 use of notional amounts
 and analysis of exposures with and without        counterparty hedges
 as set out in srp30
13
 a bank should establish internal        position limits for concentrations to which it may be exposed
 when conducting        periodic stress tests 
see srp30
45 to srp30
47
""
 a bank should incorporate all        major risk concentrations and identify and respond to potential changes in        market conditions  could adversely impact ir performance and capital        adequacy
    30
27 the assessment of such risks under a banks icaap and  supervisory review        process should not be a mechanical process
 but one in which each bank        determines
 depending on its business model
 its own specific vulnerabilities
 an        appropriate level of capital for risk concentrations should be incorporated in a        banks icaap
 as well as in pillar 2 assessments
 each bank should discuss such        issues with its supervisor
      30
28 a bank should have in place effective internal policies
 systems and controls to        identify
 measure
 monitor
 manage
 control and mitigate its risk concentrations in        a timely manner
 not only should normal market conditions be considered
 but        also  potential build-up of concentrations under stressed market conditions
        economic downturns and periods of general market illiquidity
 in addition
            bank should assess scenarios  consider possible concentrations arising from         contractual and non-contractual contingent claims
 the scenarios should also         combine  potential build-up of pipeline exposures toger with  loss of         market liquidity and a significant decline in asset values
      reputational risk  30
29 reputational risk can be defined as  risk arising from negative perception on         part of customers
 counterparties
 shareholders
 investors
 debt-holders
        market analysts
 or relevant parties or regulators  can adversely affect a        banks ability to maintain existing
 or establish new
 business relationships and        continued access to sources of funding 
eg through  interbank or        securitisation markets
""
 reputational risk is multidimensional and reflects         perception of or market participants
 furrmore
 it exists throughout         organisation and exposure to reputational risk is essentially a function of         adequacy of  banks internal risk management processes
 as well as         manner and efficiency with which management responds to external influences        on bank-related transactions
    30
30 reputational risk can lead to  provision of implicit support
 which may give        rise to credit
 liquidity
 market and legal risk  all of which can have a negative        impact on a banks earnings
 liquidity and capital position
 a bank should identify        potential sources of reputational risk to which it is exposed
 these include         banks business lines
 liabilities
 affiliated operations
 off-balance sheet vehicles        and  markets in which it operates
 the risks  arise should be incorporated        into  banks risk management processes and appropriately addressed in its        icaap and liquidity contingency plans
    30
31 prior to  2007 upheaval
 many banks failed to recognise  reputational risk        associated with ir off-balance sheet vehicles
 in stressed conditions some firms        went beyond ir contractual obligations to support ir sponsored        securitisations and off-balance sheet vehicles
 a bank should incorporate         exposures  could give rise to reputational risk into its assessments of wher         requirements under  securitisation framework have been met and         potential adverse impact of providing implicit support
  30
32 reputational risk may arise
 for example
 from a banks sponsorship of        securitisation structures such as asset-backed commercial paper conduits and        sivs
 as well as from  sale of credit exposures to securitisation trusts
 it may         also arise from a banks involvement in asset or funds management
 particularly         when financial instruments are issued by owned or sponsored entities and are         distributed to  customers of  sponsoring bank
 in  event           instruments were not correctly priced or  main risk drivers not adequately         disclosed
 a sponsor may feel some responsibility to its customers
 or be         economically compelled
 to cover any losses
 reputational risk also arises when a         bank sponsors activities such as money market mutual funds
 in-house hedge         funds and real estate investment trusts
 in se cases
" a bank may decide to         support  value of shares/units held by investors even though is not         contractually required to provide  support"
    30
33 reputational risk also may affect a banks liabilities
 since market confidence and        a banks ability to fund its business are closely related to its reputation
 for        instance
 to avoid damaging its reputation
 a bank may call its liabilities even        though this might negatively affect its liquidity profile
 this is particularly true for        liabilities  are components of regulatory capital
" such as hybrid/subordinated        debt"
 in such cases
 a banks capital position is likely to suffer
    30
34 bank management should have appropriate policies in place to identify sources        of reputational risk when entering new markets
 products or lines of activities
 in        addition
 a banks stress testing procedures should take account of reputational        risk so management has a firm understanding of  consequences and second        round effects of reputational risk
    30
35 once a bank identifies potential exposures arising from reputational concerns
 it        should measure  amount of support it might have to provide 
including        implicit support of securitisations
 or losses it might experience under adverse        market conditions
 in particular
 in order to avoid reputational damages and to        maintain market confidence
 a bank should develop methodologies to measure        as precisely as possible  effect of reputational risk in terms of or risk types        
eg credit
 liquidity
 market or operational risk
 to which it may be exposed
 this        could be accomplished by including reputational risk scenarios in regular stress        tests
 for instance
 non-contractual off-balance sheet exposures could be        included in  stress tests to determine  effect on a banks credit
 market and        liquidity risk profiles
 methodologies also could include comparing  actual        amount of exposure carried on  balance sheet versus  maximum exposure        amount held off-balance sheet
  is
  potential amount to which  bank        could be exposed
          30
36 a bank should pay particular attention to  effects of reputational risk on its        overall liquidity position
 taking into account both possible increases in  asset        side of  balance sheet and possible restrictions on funding
 should  loss of         reputation result in various counterparties loss of confidence

      valuation practices  30
37 in order to enhance  supervisory assessment of banks valuation practices
         basel committee published supervisory guidance for assessing banks financial        instrument fair value practices in april 2009
 this guidance applies to all        positions  are measured at fair value and at all times
 not only during times of        stress
        see also  basel committees paper fair value measurement and                     modelling
 an assessment of challenges and lessons learned from                      market stress
 may 2008
      30
38 the characteristics of complex structured products
 including securitisation        transactions
 make ir valuation inherently difficult due
 in part
 to  absence        of active and liquid markets
  complexity and uniqueness of  cash        waterfalls
 and  links between valuations and underlying risk factors
 the        absence of a transparent price from a liquid market means   valuation        must rely on models or proxy-pricing methodologies
 as well as on expert        judgment
 the outputs of such models and processes are highly sensitive to         inputs and parameter assumptions adopted
 which may mselves be subject to        estimation error and uncertainty
 moreover
 calibration of  valuation        methodologies is often complicated by  lack of readily available benchmarks
    30
39 therefore
 a bank is expected to have adequate governance structures and        control processes for fair valuing exposures for risk management and financial        reporting purposes
 the valuation governance structures and related processes        should be embedded in  overall governance structure of  bank
 and        consistent for both risk management and reporting purposes
 the governance        structures and processes are expected to explicitly cover  role of  board        and senior management
 in addition
  board should receive reports from        senior management on  valuation oversight and valuation model performance        issues  are brought to senior management for resolution
 as well as all        significant changes to valuation policies
          30
40            a bank should also have clear and robust governance structures for           production
 assignment and verification of financial instrument valuations
          policies should ensure   approvals of all valuation methodologies are well          documented
 in addition
 policies and procedures should set forth  range of          acceptable practices for  initial pricing
" marking-to-market/model"
 valuation          adjustments and periodic independent revaluation
 new product approval          processes should include all internal stakeholders relevant to risk measurement
          risk control
 and  assignment and verification of valuations of financial          instruments
    30
41 a banks control processes for measuring and reporting valuations should be        consistently applied across  firm and integrated with risk measurement and        management processes
 in particular
 valuation controls should be applied        consistently across similar instruments 
risks
 and consistent across business lines        
books
""
 these controls should be subject to internal audit
 regardless of         booking location of a new product
 reviews and approval of valuation        methodologies must be guided by a minimum set of considerations
        furrmore
"  valuation/new product approval process should be supported        by a transparent"
 well-documented inventory of acceptable valuation        methodologies  are specific to products and businesses
    30
42 in order to establish and verify valuations for instruments and transactions in        which it engages
 a bank must have adequate capacity
 including during periods        of stress
 this capacity should be commensurate with  importance
 riskiness        and size of se exposures in  context of  business profile of         institution
 in addition
 for those exposures  represent material risk
 a bank is        expected to have  capacity to produce valuations using alternative methods in         event  primary inputs and approaches become unreliable
 unavailable or        not relevant due to market discontinuities or illiquidity
 a bank must test and        review  performance of its models under stress conditions so  it        understands  limitations of  models under stress conditions
          30
43 the relevance and reliability of valuations is directly related to  quality and        reliability of  inputs
 a bank is expected to apply  accounting guidance        provided to determine  relevant market information and or factors likely to        have a material effect on an instrument  fair value when selecting         appropriate inputs to use in  valuation process
 where values are determined        to be in an active market
 a bank should maximise  use of relevant observable        inputs and minimise  use of unobservable inputs when estimating fair value        using a valuation technique
 however
 where a market is deemed inactive
        observable inputs or transactions may not be relevant
 such as in a forced        liquidation or distress sale
 or transactions may not be observable
 such as when        markets are inactive
 in such cases
 accounting fair value guidance provides           assistance on what should be considered
 but may not be determinative
 in         assessing wher a source is reliable and relevant
 a bank should consider
         among or things
           
1
"  frequency and availability of  prices/quotes"
           
2
 wher those prices represent actual regularly occurring transactions on an             arm  length basis
           
3
  breadth of  distribution of  data and wher it is generally             available to  relevant participants in  market
           
4
  timeliness of  information relative to  frequency of valuations
           
5
"  number of independent sources  produce  quotes/prices"
           
6
" wher  quotes/prices are supported by actual transactions"
           
7
  maturity of  market
 and           
8
  similarity between  financial instrument sold in a transaction and              instrument held by  institution
    30
44 a banks external reporting should provide timely
 relevant
 reliable and decision
       useful information  promotes transparency
 senior management should        consider wher disclosures around valuation uncertainty can be made more        meaningful
 for instance
  bank may describe  modelling techniques and         instruments to which y are applied
  sensitivity of fair values to        modelling inputs and assumptions
 and  impact of stress scenarios on        valuations
 a bank should regularly review its disclosure policies to ensure          information disclosed continues to be relevant to its business model and        products and to current market conditions
          sound stress testing practices  30
45 stress testing is a critical element of risk management for banks and a core tool        for banking supervisors and macroprudential authorities
 it is integral to banks        risk management and banking supervision
 in  stress testing alerts bank        management and supervisory authorities to unexpected adverse outcomes        related to a broad variety of risks
 and provides an indication to banks and        supervisory authorities of  financial resources  might be needed to absorb        losses should large shocks occur
    30
46 stress testing practices have evolved significantly over time
 the increasing        importance of stress testing
 combined with a significant range of approaches        adopted by supervisory authorities and banks
 highlight  need for high-level        principles to guide all elements of a sound stress testing framework
 to this end
         committee has in place stress testing principles  cover sound stress        testing practices for application to large
 internationally active banks and to        supervisory and or relevant financial authorities in basel committee member        jurisdictions
 these principles are set at a high level so  y may be        applicable across many banks and jurisdictions and to help ensure ir relevance        as stress testing practices evolve over time
 the principles set out guidance         focuses on  core elements of stress testing frameworks

47 the principles are intended to be applied on a proportionate basis
 depending on        size
 complexity and risk profile of  bank or banking sector for which         authority is responsible
 this recognises  smaller banks and authorities in all        jurisdictions can benefit from considering in a structured way  potential        impact of adverse scenarios on ir business

49 a bank is expected to be able to thoroughly identify
 measure and control        liquidity risks
 especially with regard to complex products and contingent        commitments 
both contractual and non-contractual
""
 this process should involve         ability to project cash flows arising from assets
 liabilities and off-balance        sheet items over various time horizons
 and should ensure diversification in both         tenor and source of funding
 a bank should utilise early warning indicators to        identify  emergence of increased risk or vulnerabilities in its liquidity position        or funding needs
 it should have  ability to control liquidity risk exposure and        funding needs
 regardless of its organisation structure
 within and across legal        entities
 business lines
 and currencies
 taking into account any legal
 regulatory        and operational limitations to  transferability of liquidity
    30
50 a key element in  management of liquidity risk is  need for strong        governance of liquidity risk
 including  setting of a liquidity risk tolerance by         board
 the risk tolerance should be communicated throughout  bank and        reflected in  strategy and policies  senior management set to manage        liquidity risk
 anor facet of liquidity risk management is  a bank should        appropriately price  costs
 benefits and risks of liquidity into  internal        pricing
 performance measurement
 and new product approval process of all        significant business activities
      30
51 while banks typically manage liquidity under normal circumstances
 y should        also be prepared to manage liquidity under stressed conditions
 a bank should        perform stress tests or scenario analyses on a regular basis in order to identify        and quantify ir exposures to possible future liquidity stresses
 analysing        possible impacts on  institutions cash flows
 liquidity positions
 profitability
        and solvency
 the results of se stress tests should be discussed thoroughly by        management
 and based on this discussion
 should form  basis for taking        remedial or mitigating actions to limit  banks exposures
 build up a liquidity        cushion
 and adjust its liquidity profile to fit its risk tolerance
 the results of stress        tests should also play a key role in shaping  banks contingency funding               planning
 which should outline policies for managing a range of stress events and         clearly sets out strategies for addressing liquidity shortfalls in emergency         situations
    30
52 senior management should consider  relationship between liquidity and        capital since liquidity risk can impact capital adequacy which
 in turn
 can        aggravate a banks liquidity profile

 when interest rates change
          present value and timing of future cash flows change
 this in turn changes          underlying value of a banks assets
 liabilities and off-balance sheet items and         hence its economic value
 changes in interest rates also affect a banks earnings         by altering interest rate-sensitive income and expenses
 affecting its net interest         income

 gap risk arises from  term structure of banking book instruments

 option risk arises from option derivative positions or from optional elements             embedded in a banks assets
" liabilities and/or off-balance sheet items"
             where  bank or its customer can alter  level and timing of ir cash             flows

3   while  three sub-types listed above are directly linked to irrbb
 credit spread         risk in  banking book

4   the following principles define supervisory expectations on  management of         irrbb
 principles 1 to 7 are of general application for  management of irrbb
         covering expectations for a banks irrbb management process
 in particular          need for effective irrbb identification
 measurement
 monitoring and control         activities
 principles 8 and 9 set out  expectations for market disclosures and         banks internal assessment of capital adequacy for irrbb respectively
         principles 10 to 12 address  supervisory approach to banks irrbb         management framework and capital adequacy
           
1
 irrbb is an important risk for all banks  must be specifically identified
             measured
 monitored and controlled
 in addition
 banks should monitor and             assess csrbb
           
2
 the governing body of each bank is responsible for oversight of  irrbb             management framework
 and  banks risk appetite for irrbb
 monitoring             and management of irrbb may be delegated by  governing body to             senior management

 involving regular independent reviews and             evaluations of  effectiveness of  system
           
3
 the banks risk appetite for irrbb should be articulated in terms of  risk             to both economic value and earnings
 banks must implement policy limits              target maintaining irrbb exposures consistent with ir risk appetite
           
4
 measurement of irrbb should be based on outcomes of both economic             value and earnings-based measures
 arising from a wide and appropriate             range of interest rate shock and stress scenarios
           
5
 in measuring irrbb
 key behavioural and modelling assumptions should be             fully understood
 conceptually sound and documented
 such assumptions             should be rigorously tested and aligned with  banks business strategies
           
6
 measurement systems and models used for irrbb should be based on             accurate data
 and subject to appropriate documentation
 testing and             controls to give assurance on  accuracy of calculations
 models used to             measure irrbb should be comprehensive and covered by governance             processes for model risk management
 including a validation function  is             independent of  development process
               
7
 measurement outcomes of irrbb and hedging strategies should be reported             to  governing body or its delegates on a regular basis
 at relevant levels             of aggregation 
by consolidation level and currency

8
 information on  level of irrbb exposure and practices for measuring and             controlling irrbb must be disclosed to  public on a regular basis
           
9
 capital adequacy for irrbb must be specifically considered as part of              internal capital adequacy assessment process

 banks              identified as outliers must be considered as potentially having undue              irrbb
 when a review of a banks irrbb exposure reveals inadequate              management or excessive risk relative to capital
 earnings or general risk              profile
" supervisors must require mitigation actions and/or additional capital"
    31
5   the implementation of se principles should be commensurate with  banks         nature
 size and complexity as well as its structure
 economic significance and         general risk profile
 this requires  supervisors gauge ir responses where         appropriate for banks with low irrbb profiles
 in particular
 supervisors will focus         on systemic risks  are inherent in large
 complex or internationally active         banks
          principle 1  identification and monitoring of irrbb  31
6   irrbb is an important risk  arises from banking activities
 and is encountered         by all banks
 it arises because interest rates can vary significantly over time
 while          business of banking typically involves intermediation activity  produces         exposures to both maturity mismatch 
eg long-maturity assets funded by short
        maturity liabilities
 and rate mismatch 
eg fixed rate loans funded by variable rate         deposits
""
 in addition
 re are optionalities embedded in many of  common         banking products 
eg non-maturity deposits
 term deposits
 fixed rate loans
          are triggered in accordance with changes in interest rates
    31
7   all banks must be familiar with all elements of irrbb
 actively identify ir irrbb         exposures and take appropriate steps to measure
 monitor and control it
    31
8   banks must identify  irrbb inherent in products and activities
 and ensure          se are subject to adequate procedures and controls
 significant hedging or         risk management initiatives must be approved before being implemented
         products and activities  are new to a bank must undergo a careful         preacquisition review to ensure   irrbb characteristics are well understood         and subject to a predetermined test phase before being fully rolled out
 prior to         introducing a new product
 hedging or risk-taking strategy
 adequate operational         procedures and risk control systems must be in place
 the management of a bank         s irrbb should be integrated within its broader risk management framework and         aligned with its business planning and budgeting activities

9   in identifying
 measuring
 monitoring and controlling irrbb

 all        irrbb policies should be reviewed periodically 
at least annually

 or avoid
 in                      order to achieve its business objectives

23 policy limits set by  governing bodies should be consistent with  banks        overall approach for measuring irrbb
 aggregate risk limits
 clearly articulating         amount of irrbb acceptable to  governing body
 should be applied on a        consolidated basis and
 as appropriate
 at  level of individual affiliates
" limits        may be associated with specific scenarios of changes in interest rates and/or term        structures"
 such as an increase or decrease of a particular size or a change in        shape
 the interest rate movements used in developing se limits should        represent meaningful shock and stress situations
 taking into account historical        interest rate volatility and  time required by management to mitigate those        risk exposures

 including  various sources of  banks        irrbb exposures
 banks with significant exposures to gap risk
 basis risk or           positions with explicit or embedded options should establish risk tolerances         appropriate for se risks
    31
25 the governing body or its delegates should approve major hedging or risk-taking        initiatives in advance of implementation
 a dedicated set of risk limits should be        developed to monitor  evolution of hedging strategies  rely on        instruments such as derivatives
 and to control mark-to-market risks in        instruments  are accounted for at market value
 proposals to use new        instrument types or new strategies 
including hedging
 should be assessed to        ensure   resources required to establish sound and effective irrbb        management of  product or activity have been identified
   proposed        activities are in line with  banks overall risk appetite

 under specific circumstances
 breaches of limits                     can be tolerated for a predetermined short period of time
          principle 4  irrbb measurement  31
27 banks internal measurement systems 
ims
 should capture all material sources of        irrbb and assess  effect of market changes on  scope of ir activities
 in        addition to  impact of an interest rate shock on its economic value
 a banks        policy approach should take into account its ability to generate stable earnings        sufficient to maintain its normal business operations
    31
28 banks should pay attention to  complementary nature of economic value and        earnings-based measures in ir risk and internal capital assessments
 in        particular in terms of
           
1
 outcomes
 economic value measures compute a change in  net present             value of  banks assets
 liabilities and off-balance sheet items subject to             specific interest rate shock and stress scenarios
 while earnings-based             measures focus on changes to future profitability within a given time horizon             eventually affecting future levels of a banks own equity capital
           
2
 assessment horizons
 economic value measures reflect changes in value over              remaining life of  banks assets
 liabilities and off-balance sheet items
             ie until all positions have run off
 while earnings-based measures cover only              short to medium term
 and refore do not fully capture those risks              will continue to impact profit and loss accounts beyond  period of             estimation
 and           
3
" future business/production"
 economic value measures consider  net             present value of repricing cash flows of instruments on  banks balance             sheet or accounted for as an off-balance sheet item 
ie a run-off view
""
             earnings measures may
 in addition to a run-off view
 assume rollover of             maturing items 
ie a constant balance sheet view
" and/or assess  scenario"
            consistent impact on  banks future earnings inclusive of future business             
ie a dynamic view
""
   a dynamic view can be useful for business planning and budgeting                     purposes
 however
 dynamic approaches are dependent on key                     variables and assumptions  are extremely difficult to project with                     accuracy over an extended period and can potentially hide certain key                     underlying risk exposures
        31
29 while  economic value and earnings-based measures share certain        commonalities
  committee observes  most commercial banks primarily        utilise  latter for irrbb management
 whereas regulators tend to endorse          former as a benchmark for comparability and capital adequacy
 the committee         acknowledges  importance of managing irrbb through both economic value         and earnings-based measures
 if a bank solely minimises its economic value risk         by matching  repricing of its assets with liabilities beyond  short term
 it         could run  risk of earnings volatility
    31
30 banks ims for irrbb should be able to accommodate  calculation of         impact on economic value and earnings of multiple scenarios
 based on
           
1
 internally selected interest rate shock scenarios addressing  banks risk             profile
 according to its icaap
           
2
 historical and hypotical interest rate stress scenarios
 which tend to be             more severe than shock scenarios
           
3
  six prescribed interest rate shock scenarios set out in srp31
90 to srp31
             93
 and           
4
 any additional interest rate shock scenarios required by supervisors
    31
31 banks should measure ir vulnerability to loss under stressful market conditions         including  breakdown of key assumptions  and consider those results when        establishing and reviewing ir policies and limits for irrbb
    31
32 a bank should develop and implement an effective stress testing framework for        irrbb as part of its broader risk management and governance processes
 this        should feed into  decision-making process at  appropriate management        level
 including strategic decisions 
eg business and capital planning decisions
 of         governing body or its delegates
 in particular
 irrbb stress testing should be        considered in  icaap
 requiring banks to undertake rigorous
 forward-looking        stress testing  identifies events of severe changes in market conditions which        could adversely impact  banks capital or earnings
 possibly also through        changes in  behaviour of its customer base
      31
33 a banks stress testing framework for irrbb should be commensurate with its        nature
 size and complexity as well as business activities and overall risk profile
        the framework should include clearly defined objectives
 scenarios tailored to         banks businesses and risks
 well documented assumptions and sound        methodologies
 the framework will be used to assess  potential impact of         scenarios on  banks financial condition
 enable ongoing and effective review        processes for stress tests and recommend actions based on  stress test results
               irrbb stress tests should play an important role in  communication of risks
         both within  bank and externally with supervisors and  market through         appropriate disclosures
    31
34 the identification of relevant shock and stress scenarios for irrbb
  application        of sound modelling approaches and  appropriate use of  stress testing        results require  collaboration of different experts within a bank 
eg traders
         treasury department
  finance department
  alco
"  risk management        and risk control departments and/or  banks economists"
""
 a stress-testing        programme for irrbb should ensure   opinions of  experts are taken        into account
    31
35 banks should determine
 by currency
 a range of potential interest rate        movements against which y will measure ir irrbb exposures
 management        should ensure  risk is measured under a reasonable range of potential        interest rate scenarios
 including some containing severe stress elements
 in        developing  scenarios
 banks should consider a variety of factors
 such as         shape and level of  current term structure of interest rates and  historical        and implied volatility of interest rates
 in low interest rate environments
 banks        should also consider negative interest rate scenarios and  possibility of        asymmetrical effects of negative interest rates on ir assets and liabilities
    31
36 a bank should consider  nature and sources of its irrbb exposures
  time it        would need to take action to reduce or unwind unfavourable irrbb exposures
"        and its capability/willingness to withstand accounting losses in order to        reposition its risk profile"
 a bank should select scenarios  provide meaningful        estimates of risk and include a range of shocks  is sufficiently wide to allow         governing body or its delegates to understand  risk inherent in  banks        products and activities
 when developing interest rate shock and stress scenarios        for irrbb
 banks should consider  following
           
1
 the scenarios should be sufficiently wide-ranging to identify parallel and             non-parallel gap risk
 basis risk and option risk
 in many cases
 static interest             rate shocks may be insufficient to assess irrbb exposure adequately
 banks             should ensure   scenarios are both severe and plausible
 in light of              existing level of interest rates and  interest rate cycle
           
2
 special consideration should be given to instruments or markets where             concentrations exist
 because those positions may be more difficult to             liquidate or offset in a stressful market environment
           
3
 banks should assess  possible interaction of irrbb with its related risks
 as             well as or risks 
eg credit risk
 liquidity risk
""
           
4
" banks should assess  effect of adverse changes in  spreads of new             assets/liabilities replacing those assets/liabilities maturing over  horizon             of  forecast on ir nii"
           
5
 banks with significant option risk should include scenarios  capture              exercise of such options
 for example
 banks  have products with sold             caps or floors should include scenarios  assess how  risk positions             would change should those caps or floors move into  money
 given               market value of options also fluctuates with changes in  volatility of             interest rates
 banks should develop interest rate assumptions to measure             ir irrbb exposures to changes in interest rate volatilities
           
6
 banks should specify
 in building ir interest rate shock and stress             scenarios
  term structure of interest rates  will be incorporated and              basis relationship between yield curves
 rate indices etc
 banks should             also estimate how interest rates  are administered or managed by             management 
eg prime rates or retail deposit rates
 as opposed to those              are purely market-driven
 might change
 management should document             how se assumptions are derived
    31
37 in addition
 forward-looking scenarios should incorporate changes in portfolio        composition due to factors under  control of  bank 
eg  banks        acquisition and production plans
 as well as external factors 
eg changing        competitive
 legal or tax environments
""
 new products where only limited        historical data are available
 new market information and new emerging risks         are not necessarily covered by historical stress episodes
    31
38 furr
 banks should perform qualitative and quantitative reverse stress tests in        order to
           
1
 identify interest rate scenarios  could severely threaten a banks capital             and earnings
 and              
2

        principle 5  behavioural and modelling assumptions  31
39 both economic value and earnings-based measures of irrbb are significantly        impacted by a number of assumptions made for  purposes of risk        quantification
 namely
          
1
 expectations for  exercise of interest rate options 
explicit and embedded
            by both  bank and its customers under specific interest rate shock and            stress scenarios

4
  implications of accounting practices for irrbb
    31
40 hence
 when assessing its irrbb exposures
 a bank should make judgments and        assumptions about how an instruments actual maturity or repricing behaviour        may vary from  instruments contractual terms because of behavioural        optionalities
    31
41 common products with behavioural optionalities include
          
1
 fixed rate loans subject to prepayment risk  banks should understand             nature of prepayment risk for ir portfolios and make reasonable and            prudent estimates of  expected prepayments
 the assumptions            underlying  estimates and where prepayment penalties or or            contractual features affect  embedded optionality effect should be            documented
 there are several factors  are important determinants of             banks estimate of  effect of each interest rate shock and stress            scenario on  average prepayment speed
 specifically
 a bank must assess             expected average prepayment speed under each scenario
               
2
 fixed rate loan commitments  banks may sell options to retail customers             
eg prospective mortgage buyers or renewers
 whereby
 for a limited period
               customers can choose to draw down a loan at a committed rate
 unlike              loan commitments to corporates
 where drawdowns strongly reflect              characteristics of automatic interest rate options
 mortgage commitments 
ie              pipelines
 to retail customers are impacted by or drivers
           
3
 term deposits subject to early redemption risk  banks may attract deposits             with a contractual maturity term or with step-up clauses  enable              depositor at different time periods to modify  speed of redemption
 the             classification scheme should be documented
 wher a term deposit is             deemed to be subject to redemption penalties or to or contractual             features  preserve  cash flow profile of  instrument
           
4
 nmds  behavioural assumptions for deposits  have no specific repricing             date can be a major determinant of irrbb exposures under  economic             value and earnings-based measures
 banks should document
 monitor and             regularly update key assumptions for nmd balances and behaviour used in             ir ims
 to determine  appropriate assumptions for its nmds
 a bank             should analyse its depositor base in order to identify  proportion of core             deposits 
ie nmds which are unlikely to reprice even under significant             changes in interest rate environment
""

42 modelling assumptions should be conceptually sound and reasonable
 and        consistent with historical experience
 banks must carefully consider how         exercise of  behavioural optionality will vary not only under  interest rate        shock and stress scenario but also across or dimensions
 for instance
        considerations may include those set out in table 1
           considerations affecting behavioural optionality                                      table 1  product   dimensions influencing  exercise of  embedded behavioural options  fixed rate loans subject to prepayment risk  loan size

 competition from or firms
   banks geographical location and demographic and or relevant characteristics of its  customer base
        31
43 in addition
 banks with positions denominated in different currencies can expose        mselves to irrbb in each of those currencies
 since yield curves vary from        currency to currency
 banks generally need to assess exposures in each currency
        banks with  necessary skills and sophistication
 and with material        multicurrency exposures
 may choose to include
 in ir ims
 methods to        aggregate ir irrbb in different currencies using assumptions about         correlation between interest rates in different currencies
      31
44                furr
 banks should consider  materiality of  impact of behavioural          optionalities within floating rate loans
 for instance
  behaviour of          prepayments arising from embedded caps and floors could impact  banks          economic value of equity
    31
45 banks should be able to test  appropriateness of key behavioural assumptions
        and all changes to  assumptions of key parameters should be documented 
eg        by comparing  economic value of equity measured under ir ims with         standardised framework in srp31
94 to srp31
129
""
 banks should periodically        perform sensitivity analyses for key assumptions to monitor ir impact on        measured irrbb
 sensitivity analyses should be performed with reference to both        economic value and earnings-based measures
    31
46 the most significant assumptions underlying  system should be documented        and clearly understood by  governing body or its delegates
 documentation        should also include descriptions on how those assumptions could potentially        affect  banks hedging strategies
    31
47 as market conditions
 competitive environments and strategies change over time
         bank should review significant measurement assumptions at least annually        and more frequently during rapidly changing market conditions
 for example
 if         competitive market has changed such  consumers now have lower        transaction costs available to m for refinancing ir residential mortgages
        prepayments may become more sensitive to smaller reductions in interest rates
      principle 6  data integrity and model governance  31
48 accurate and timely measurement of irrbb is necessary for effective risk        management and control
 a banks risk measurement system should be able to        identify and quantify  major sources of irrbb exposure
 the mix of a banks        business lines and  risk characteristics of its activities should guide        managements selection of  most appropriate form of measurement system
    31
49 banks should not rely on a single measure of risk
 given  risk management        systems tend to vary in how y capture  components of irrbb
 instead
        banks should use a variety of methodologies to quantify ir irrbb exposures        under both  economic value and earnings-based measures
 ranging from        simple calculations based on static simulations using current holdings to more        sophisticated dynamic modelling techniques  reflect potential future business        activities
      31
50          a banks mis should allow it to retrieve accurate irrbb information in a timely          manner
 the mis should capture interest rate risk data on all  banks material          irrbb exposures
 there should be sufficient documentation of  major data          sources used in  banks risk measurement process
    31
51 data inputs should be automated as much as possible to reduce administrative        errors
 data mapping should be periodically reviewed and tested against an        approved model version
 a bank should monitor  type of data extracts and set        appropriate controls
    31
52 where cash flows are slotted into different time buckets 
eg for gap analyses
 or        assigned to different vertex points to reflect  different tenors of  interest        rate curve
  slotting criteria should be stable over time to allow for a        meaningful comparison of risk figures over different periods
    31
53 banks ims should be able to compute economic value and earnings-based        measures of irrbb
 as well as or measures of irrbb prescribed by ir        supervisors
 based on  interest rate shock and stress scenarios set out in srp31
        30
 it should also be sufficiently flexible to incorporate supervisory-imposed        constraints on banks internal risk parameter estimates
    31
54 the validation of irrbb measurement methods and assessment of corresponding        model risk should be included in a formal policy process  should be reviewed        and approved by  governing body or its delegates
 the policy should specify         management roles and designate who is responsible for  development
        implementation and use of models
 in addition
  model oversight        responsibilities as well as policies including  development of initial and        ongoing validation procedures
 evaluation of results
 approval
 version control
        exception
 escalation
 modification and decommission processes need to be        specified and integrated within  governance processes for model risk        management
    31
55 an effective validation framework should include three core elements
            
1
" evaluation of conceptual/methodological soundness"
 including              developmental evidence
            
2
 ongoing model monitoring
 including process verification and              benchmarking
 and            
3

eg              stability of deposits
 prepayments
 early redemptions
 pricing of instruments
""
        31
56 in addressing  expected initial and ongoing validation activities
  policy        should establish a hierarchical process for determining model risk soundness           based on both quantitative and qualitative dimensions such as size
 impact
 past         performance and familiarity with  modelling technique employed
    31
57 model risk management for irrbb measures should follow a holistic approach         begins with motivation
 development and implementation by model owners        and users
 prior to receiving authorisation for usage
  process for determining        model inputs
 assumptions
 modelling methodologies and outputs should be        reviewed and validated independently of  development of irrbb models
 the        review and validation results and any recommendations on model usage should        be presented to and approved by  governing body or its delegates
 upon        approval
  model should be subject to ongoing review
 process verification        and validation at a frequency  is consistent with  level of model risk        determined and approved by  bank
    31
58 the ongoing validation process should establish a set of exception trigger events         obligate  model reviewers to notify  governing body or its delegates in        a timely fashion
" in order to determine corrective actions and/or restrictions on        model usage"
 clear version control authorisations should be designated
 where        appropriate
 to model owners
 with  passage of time and due to observations        and new information gained over time
 an approved model may be modified or        decommissioned
 banks should articulate policies for model transition
 including        change and version control authorisations and documentation
    31
59 irrbb models might include those developed by third-party vendors
 model        inputs or assumptions may also be sourced from related modelling processes or        sub-models 
both in-house and vendor-sourced
 and should be included in         validation process
 the bank should document and explain model specification        choices as part of  validation process
    31
60 banks  purchase irrbb models should ensure re is adequate        documentation of ir use of those models
 including any specific customisation
        if vendors provide input for market data
 behavioural assumptions or model        settings
  bank should have a process in place to determine if those inputs are        reasonable for its business and  risk characteristics of its activities
    31
61 internal audit should review  model risk management process as part of its        annual risk assessment and audit plans
 the audit activity should not duplicate        model risk management processes
 but should review  integrity and        effectiveness of  risk management system and  model risk management        process
          principle 7  reporting to management  31
62 the reporting of risk measures to  governing body or its delegates should be        regular and should compare current exposure with policy limits
 in particular
        reporting should include  results of  periodic model reviews and audits as        well as comparisons of past forecasts or risk estimates with actual results to        inform potential modelling shortcomings on a regular basis
 portfolios  may        be subject to significant mark-to-market movements should be clearly identified        within  banks mis and subject to oversight in line with any or portfolios        exposed to market risk
    31
63 while  types of reports prepared for  governing body or its delegates will        vary based on  banks portfolio composition

64 reports detailing  banks irrbb exposures should be provided to  banks        governing body or its delegates on a timely basis and reviewed regularly
 the        irrbb reports should provide aggregate information as well as sufficient        supporting detail to enable  governing body or its delegates to assess         sensitivity of  bank to changes in market conditions
 with particular reference        to portfolios  may potentially be subject to significant mark-to-market        movements
 the governing body or its delegates should review  banks irrbb        management policies and procedures in light of  reports
 to ensure  y        remain appropriate and sound
 the governing body or its delegates should also        ensure  analysis and risk management activities related to irrbb are        conducted by competent staff with technical knowledge and experience

1
 the eve under a variety of shocked and stressed interest rate scenarios
             where a banks eve is significantly sensitive to interest rate shocks and             stresses

" including those related to               inclusion/exclusion of commercial margins"
  banks actual equity              allocation profile
  stability of nmds and prepayment optionality
           
2
 the strength and stability of  earnings stream and  level of income             needed to generate and maintain normal business operations
 a high level             of irrbb exposure is one  could
 under a plausible range of market             scenarios
 result in  bank reporting losses or curtailing normal dividend             distribution and business operations
 in such cases
 management should             ensure   bank has sufficient capital to withstand  adverse impact of             such events until it can implement mitigating actions such as reducing             exposures or increasing capital
    31
86 when a supervisor determines  a banks ims is deficient in its measurement        of irrbb
"  supervisor should require  bank to improve its ims and/or use         standardised framework set out in srp31"

    31
87 a bank could also be considered to have excessive risk relative to earnings if its        shocked nii was such   bank would not have sufficient income to        maintain its normal business operations
    31
88 when a national supervisor concludes  a banks management of irrbb is        inadequate or  it has excessive risk relative to its capital or earnings

 reduce its irrbb exposures 
eg by hedging
""
           
2
 raise additional capital

    the standardised interest rate shock scenarios  31
90 banks should apply six prescribed interest rate shock scenarios to capture parallel        and non-parallel gap risks for eve and two prescribed interest rate shock        scenarios for nii
 the derivation of se shocks is explained in srp98
56 to        srp98
63
 these scenarios are applied to irrbb exposures in each currency for        which  bank has material positions
 in order to accommodate heterogeneous        economic environments across jurisdictions
  six shock scenarios reflect        currency-specific absolute shocks as specified in table 2 below
 for  purposes        of capturing  local rate environment
 a historical time series ranging from 2000        to 2015 for various maturities was used to derive each scenario for a given        currency
 under this approach
 irrbb is measured by means of  following six        scenarios
           
1
 parallel shock up
           
2
 parallel shock down

91 given table 2
  instantaneous shocks to  risk-free rate for parallel
 short        and long
 for each currency
  following parameterisations of  six interest        rate shock scenarios should be applied
           
1
 parallel shock for currency c
 a constant parallel shock up or down across all             time buckets
                 
2
 short rate shock for currency c
 shock up or down  is greatest at              shortest tenor midpoint
 that shock
 through  shaping scalar
 diminishes towards  zero at  tenor of                 longest point in  term structure
                 
3
 long rate shock for currency c 
note
 this is used only in  rotational             shocks
""
 here  shock is greatest at  longest tenor midpoint and is                related to  short scaling factor as
                       
                 
4
 rotation shocks for currency c
 involving rotations to  term structure 
ie             steepeners and flatteners
 of  interest rates whereby both  long and             short rates are shocked and  shift in interest rates at each tenor midpoint             is obtained by applying  following formulas to those shocks
      the value of x in  denominator of  function         controls                      rate of decay of  shock
 this should be set to  value of 4 for most                     currencies and  related shocks unless orwise determined by                     national supervisors

 for this reason
  committee will        review  calibration of  interest rate shock sizes 
eg every five years

        national supervisors may
 at ir discretion
 set floors for  post-shock interest        rates under  six interest rate shock scenarios

 for            positions less amenable to standardisation
 y are excluded from this step
            for positions with embedded automatic interest rate options

 behavioural options 
fixed rate loans subject to prepayment risk and                 term deposits subject to early redemption risk
  behavioural                 parameters relevant to  position type must rely on a scenario

 determination of eve for relevant interest rate shock scenarios for each            currency
 the eve is measured per currency for all six prescribed interest            rate shock scenarios
          
4
 add-ons for changes in  value of automatic interest rate options 
wher            explicit or embedded
 are added to  eve changes
 automatic interest rate            options sold are subject to full revaluation 
possibly net of automatic interest            rate options bought to hedge sold interest rate options

 irrbb eve calculation
 the eve under  standardised framework will be             maximum of  worst aggregated reductions to eve across  six            supervisory prescribed interest rate shocks
          that is
  embedded automatic interest rate option is stripped out                       from  process of slotting notional repricing cash flows in step 2 and                       treated toger with or automatic interest rate options under step                       4

96 banks must project all future notional repricing cash flows arising from interest        rate-sensitive assets
 liabilities and off-balance sheet items on to
           
1
 19 predefined time buckets 
indexed numerically by k

 or           
2
  time bucket midpoints as set out in table 3
 retaining  notional             repricing cash flows maturity
 this alternative requires splitting up notional             repricing cash flows between two adjacent maturity bucket midpoints
                maturity schedule with 19 time buckets for notional repricing cash flows              repriciting at tcf                the number in brackets is  time buckets midpoint                                table 3      31
97 for  purpose of this approach
 assets are those not deducted from cet1        capital and exclude fixed assets 
such as real estate or intangible assets
 and           equity exposures in  banking book
 liabilities include all non-remunerated         deposits but exclude cet1 capital under  basel iii framework
    31
98 a notional repricing cash flow cf
k
 is defined as
           
1
 any repayment of principal 
eg at contractual maturity
""
           
2
 any repricing of principal
 repricing is said to occur at  earliest date at             which eir  bank or its counterparty is entitled to unilaterally change              interest rate
 or at which  rate on a floating rate instrument changes             automatically in response to a change in an external benchmark
 or           
3
 any interest payment on a tranche of principal  has not yet been repaid             or repriced
 spread components of interest payments on a tranche of             principal  has not yet been repaid and which do not reprice must be             slotted until ir contractual maturity irrespective of wher  non
            amortised principal has been repriced or not
    31
99 the date of each repayment
 repricing or interest payment is referred to as its        repricing date
    31
100 banks have  choice of wher to deduct commercial margins and or        spread components from  notional repricing cash flows
 using a prudent and        transparent methodology
    31
101 floating rate instruments are assumed to reprice fully at  first reset date
        hence
  entire principal amount is slotted into  bucket in which  date        falls
 with no additional slotting of notional repricing cash flows to later time        buckets or time bucket midpoints 
or than  spread component which is not        repriced
""
    31
102 all notional repricing cash flows associated with interest rate-sensitive assets
        liabilities and off-balance sheet items
 for each currency
 are allocated to         prescribed time buckets or time bucket midpoints 
henceforth
 denoted by under interest  rate shock scenario i and currency c
 based on ir         amenability to standardisation
    31
103 notional repricing cash flows can be slotted into appropriate time buckets or        time bucket midpoints based on ir contractual maturity
 if subject to fixed        coupons
 or into  next repricing period if coupons are floating
 positions        amenable to standardisation fall into two categories
             
1
 fixed rate positions
 such positions generate cash flows  are certain till              point of contractual maturity
 examples are fixed rate loans without             embedded prepayment options
 term deposits without redemption risk and             or amortising products such as mortgage loans
 all coupon cash flows             and periodic or final principal repayments should be allocated to  time             bucket midpoints closest to  contractual maturity
           
2
 floating rate positions
 such positions generate cash flows  are not             predictable past  next repricing date or than   present value             would be reset to par
 accordingly
 such instruments can be treated as a             series of coupon payments until  next repricing and a par notional cash             flow at  time bucket midpoint closest to  next reset date bucket
    31
104 positions amenable to standardisation include positions with embedded        automatic interest rate options where  optionality 
wher sold or bought
        should be ignored for  purpose of slotting of notional repricing cash flows
        that is
  stripped-out embedded automatic interest rate option must be        treated toger with explicit automatic interest rate options
 supervisors may        allow banks to categorise or positions as amenable to standardisation and        ignore  optionality if it can be shown to be of immaterial consequence
     for example
 a floating rate loan or debt security with a floor would be                     treated as if re were no floor
 hence it would be treated as if it fully                     repriced at  next reset date
 and its full outstanding balance slotted                     in  corresponding time band
 similarly
 a callable bond issued by a                     bank at a fixed yield would be treated as if it matured at its longest                     contractual term
 ignoring  call option
      31
105 some positions are less amenable to standardisation
 for explicit automatic        interest rate options
 as well as embedded automatic interest rate options         are separated or stripped out from  banks assets or liabilities 
ie  host        contract
""
  methodology for automatic interest rate options is described in        srp31
127 and srp31
128
       a common feature of se positions is optionality  makes                      timing of notional repricing cash flows uncertain
 this optionality                     introduces a non-linearity
 which suggests  delta-equivalent                     approximations are imprecise for large interest rate shock scenarios
"    an example of a product with embedded automatic interest rate                     options is a floating rate mortgage loan with embedded caps and/or                     floors"
 notional repricing cash flows for those loans are treated as a                     fixed rate loan until  next repricing date
 reby ignoring                      option
 which instead is treated like a separate automatic interest rate                     option
      31
106 positions not amenable to standardisation include           
1
 nmds
           
2
 fixed rate loans subject to prepayment risk and           
3
 term deposits subject to early redemption risk
    31
107 under  standardised framework
 banks should first separate ir nmds        according to  nature of  deposit and depositor
 banks should n identify
        for each category
  core and non-core deposits
 up to  limits specified in        table 4
 finally
 banks should determine an appropriate cash flow slotting for        each category
 in accordance with  average maturity limits specified in table 4
    31
108 nmds must be segmented into retail and wholesale categories
 retail deposits        are defined as deposits placed with a bank by an individual person
 deposits        made by small business customers and managed as retail exposures are        considered as having similar interest rate risk characteristics to retail accounts        and thus can be treated as retail deposits 
provided  total aggregated        liabilities raised from one small business customer are less than 1 million
""
 retail        deposits should be considered as held in a transactional account when regular        transactions are carried out in  account 
eg when salaries are regularly        credited
 or when  deposit is non-interest bearing
 or retail deposits        should be considered as held in a non-transactional account
 deposits from legal        entities
 sole proprietorships or partnerships are captured in wholesale deposit        categories
      a specific category may be introduced for non-remunerated deposits
                     subject to supervisory approval
          31
109 banks should distinguish between  stable and  non-stable parts of each        nmd category using observed volume changes over  past 10 years
 the stable        nmd portion is  portion  is found to remain undrawn with a high degree        of likelihood
 core deposits are  proportion of stable nmds which are unlikely        to reprice even under significant changes in  interest rate environment
 the        remainder constitutes non-core nmds
    31
110 banks are required to estimate ir level of core deposits using this two-step        procedure for each deposit category
 and n to aggregate  results to        determine  overall volume of core deposits subject to imposed caps as shown        in table 4
    31
111 nmds should finally be slotted into  appropriate time bucket or time bucket        midpoint
" non-core deposits should be considered as overnight deposits and        accordingly should be placed into  shortest/overnight time bucket or time        bucket midpoint"
    31
112 banks should determine an appropriate cash flow slotting procedure for each        category of core deposits
 up to  maximum average maturity per category as        specified in table 4
           caps on core deposits and average maturity by category                        table 4                                        cap on proportion of core  deposits

113 the treatment set out srp31
114 to srp31
126 applies only to behavioural        options related to retail customers
 where a wholesale customer has a        behavioural option  may change  pattern of notional repricing cash flows
        such options must be included within  category of automatic interest rate        options
    an example of such an option would be a puttable fixed coupon bond                     issued by  bank in  wholesale market
 for which  owner has                      right to sell  bond back to  bank at a fixed price at any time
      31
114 the standardised framework is applied to fixed rate loans subject to prepayments        and term deposits subject to early redemption risk
 in each case
  customer        has an option
 which
 if exercised
 will alter  timing of a banks cash flows
 the        customers exercise of  option is
 among or factors
 influenced by changes        in interest rates
 in  case of  fixed rate loan
  customer has an option to        repay  loan early 
ie prepay
""
 and for a fixed-term deposit
  customer may        have an option to withdraw ir deposit before  scheduled date
    31
115 under  standardised framework
  optionality in se products is estimated        using a two-step approach
 firstly
 baseline estimates of loan prepayments and        early withdrawal of fixed-term deposits are calculated given  prevailing term        structure of interest rates
  these baseline parameter estimates may be determined by  bank                     subject to supervisory review and approval
 or prescribed by                      supervisor
      31
116 in  second stage
  baseline estimates are multiplied by scenario-dependent        scalars  reflect  likely behavioural changes in  exercise of  options
    31
117 prepayments
 or parts reof
 for which  economic cost is not charged to         borrower
 are referred to as uncompensated prepayments
 for loan products        where  economic cost of prepayments is never charged
 or charged only for        prepayments above a certain threshold

 these payments can be broken up into scheduled payments adjusted        for prepayment and uncompensated prepayments according to  following             formula
 where          refers to  scheduled interest and principal repayment

       for simplicity
 we have assumed re is no annual limit on                     prepayments

122 term deposits lock in a fixed rate for a fixed term and would usually be hedged        on  basis
 however
 term deposits may be subject to  risk of early        withdrawal
 also called early redemption risk
 consequently
 term deposits may        only be treated as fixed rate liabilities and ir notional repricing cash flows        slotted into  time buckets or time bucket midpoints up to ir corresponding        contractual maturity dates if it can be shown to  satisfaction of  supervisor        
           
1
  depositor has no legal right to withdraw  deposit
 or           
2
 an early withdrawal results in a significant penalty  at least compensates             for  loss of interest between  date of withdrawal and  contractual             maturity date and  economic cost of breaking  contract
        however
 often penalties do not reflect such an economic calculation                     but instead are based on a simpler formula such as a percentage of                     accrued interest
 in such cases
 re is potential for changes to profit                     or loss arising from differences between  penalty charged and                      actual economic cost of early withdrawal
        31
123         if neir of se conditions is met
  depositor holds an option to withdraw        and  term deposits are deemed to be subject to early redemption risk
 furr
        if a bank issues term deposits  do not meet  above criteria to wholesale        customers
 it must assume   customer will always exercise  right to        withdraw in  way  is most disadvantageous to  bank

  bank must            determine  change in value of  option between interest rate shock            scenario i and  current interest rate term structure combined with a             relative increase in  implicit volatility of 25%

 options in currency c
     the most important automatic interest rate options likely to occur in                      banking book are caps and floors
 which are often embedded in                     banking products
 swaptions
 such as prepayment options on non
                    retail products
 may also be treated as automatic interest rate options
                     as
 in cases where such options are held by sophisticated financial                     market counterparties
  option holder will almost certainly exercise                      option if it is in ir financial interest to do so
 any behavioural                     option positions with wholesale customers  may change                      pattern of notional repricing cash flows are considered as embedded                     automatic interest rate options for  purposes of this subsection
     this estimate requires a methodology approved by  supervisor
      31
128 if  bank chooses to only include bought automatic interest rate options         are used for hedging sold automatic interest rate options
  bank must
 for         remaining bought options
 add any changes in market values reflected in         regulatory capital measure of  respective capital ratio

129 first
  loss in economic value of equity 
c under scenario i and currency c         is calculated for each currency with material exposures
 ie those accounting for         more than 5% of eir banking book assets or liabilities
 as follows
           
1
 under each scenario i
 all notional repricing cash flows are slotted into              respective time bucket or time bucket midpoint 
 within a given time bucket k or time  bucket midpoint 
 all positive              and negative notional repricing cash flows are netted to form a single long              or short position
 with  cancelled parts removed from  calculation
              following this process across all time buckets or time bucket midpoints leads              to a set of notional repricing cash flows                
2
 net notional repricing cash flows in each time bucket k or time bucket           midpoint  are weighted by a continuously compounded discount factor
           described below
  reflects  interest rate shock scenario i in currency c           as set out in srp31
90 to srp31
93
 and where  is  midpoint of time           bucket k
 this results in a weighted net position
 which may be positive or           negative for each time bucket
 the cash flows should be discounted using           eir a risk-free rate or a risk-free rate including commercial margin and           or spread components 
only if  bank has included commercial margins           and or spread components in its cash flows
""
             
3
 these risk-weighted net positions are summed to determine  eve in           currency c under scenario i 
excluding automatic interest rate option           positions

maturity bucket midpoints
         
4
 then
  full change in eve in currency c associated with scenario i is           obtained by subtracting          from  eve under  current interest rate             term structure         and by adding  total measure for automatic interest           rate option risk as follows
                                                                               
maturity           buckets

maturity           bucket midpoints
         
5
 finally
  eve losses  are aggregated under a given interest rate           shock scenario i and  maximum loss across all interest rate shock           scenarios is  eve risk measure
       intra-bucket mismatch risk arises as notional repricing cash flows with                   different maturity dates
 but falling within  same time bucket or                   time bucket midpoint
 are assumed to match perfectly
 this is                   mitigated by introducing a high number of time buckets 
ie k=19

     note 
 depending on  approach taken for nmds
 prepayments                   and products with or embedded behavioural options
  notional                   repricing cash flows may vary by scenario

""
    the discounting factors must be representative of a risk-free zero                   coupon rate
 an example of an acceptable yield curve is a secured                   interest rate swap curve
     national supervisors would
 however
 be allowed to prescribe a                   different method of currency aggregation for ir banks
 if                    national supervisor is able to support

 the results of  stress test will thus         contribute directly to  expectation  a bank will operate above  pillar 1         minimum regulatory capital ratios
 supervisors will consider wher a bank has         sufficient capital for se purposes
 to  extent  re is a shortfall
          supervisor will react appropriately
" this will usually involve requiring  bank to         reduce its risks and/or to hold additional capital/provisions"

      residual risk  32
3   the framework allows banks to offset credit or counterparty risk with collateral

 leading to reduced capital charges
 while banks         use credit risk mitigation 
crm
 techniques to reduce ir credit risk
 se         techniques give rise to risks  may render  overall risk reduction less         effective
 accordingly se risks

 documentation risk
 or liquidity         risk
 to which banks are exposed are of supervisory concern
 where such risks         arise
 and irrespective of fulfilling  minimum requirements set out in pillar 1
 a         bank could find itself with greater credit risk exposure to  underlying         counterparty than it had expected
 examples of se risks include
           
1
 inability to seize
 or realise in a timely manner
 collateral pledged

4   therefore
 supervisors will require banks to have in place appropriate written         crm policies and procedures in order to control se residual risks
 a bank may         be required to submit se policies and procedures to supervisors and must         regularly review ir appropriateness

5   in its crm policies and procedures
 a bank must consider wher
 when         calculating capital requirements
 it is appropriate to give  full recognition of          value of  credit risk mitigant as permitted in pillar 1 and must demonstrate          its crm management policies and procedures are appropriate to  level of         capital benefit  it is recognising
 where supervisors are not satisfied as to          robustness
 suitability or application of se policies and procedures y may         direct  bank to take immediate remedial action or hold additional capital         against residual risk until such time as  deficiencies in  crm procedures are         rectified to  satisfaction of  supervisor
 for example
 supervisors may direct         a bank to

      credit concentration risk  32
6   a risk concentration is any single exposure or group of exposures with          potential to produce losses large enough 
relative to a banks capital
 total assets
         or overall risk level
 to threaten a banks health or ability to maintain its core         operations
 risk concentrations are arguably  single most important cause of         major problems in banks

7   risk concentrations can arise in a banks assets

 or off-balance sheet         items
 through  execution or processing of transactions 
eir product or         service
""
 or through a combination of exposures across se broad categories
         because lending is  primary activity of most banks
 credit risk concentrations         are often  most material risk concentrations within a bank
      32
8   credit risk concentrations
 by ir nature
 are based on common or correlated         risk factors
 which
 in times of stress
 have an adverse effect on          creditworthiness of each of  individual counterparties making up          concentration
 concentration risk arises in both direct exposures to obligors and         may also occur through exposures to protection providers
 such concentrations         are not addressed in  pillar 1 capital charge for credit risk
    32
9   banks should have in place effective internal policies
 systems and controls to         identify
 measure
 monitor
 and control ir credit risk concentrations
 banks         should explicitly consider  extent of ir credit risk concentrations in ir         assessment of capital adequacy under pillar 2
 these policies should cover          different forms of credit risk concentrations to which a bank may be exposed
         such concentrations include
           
1
 significant exposures to an individual counterparty or group of related             counterparties
 in many jurisdictions
 supervisors define a limit for exposures             of this nature
 commonly referred to as a large exposure limit
 banks might             also establish an aggregate limit for  management and control of all of its             large exposures as a group
           
2
 credit exposures to counterparties in  same economic sector or             geographic region
           
3
 credit exposures to counterparties whose financial performance is             dependent on  same activity or commodity
 and           
4
 indirect credit exposures arising from a banks crm activities 
eg exposure to             a single collateral type or to credit protection provided by a single             counterparty

    32
10 a banks framework for managing credit risk concentrations should be clearly        documented and should include a definition of  credit risk concentrations        relevant to  bank and how se concentrations and ir corresponding limits        are calculated
 limits should be defined in relation to a banks capital
 total assets        or
 where adequate measures exist

11 a banks management should conduct periodic stress tests of its major credit risk        concentrations and review  results of those tests to identify and respond to        potential changes in market conditions  could adversely impact  banks        performance
    32
12 a bank should ensure 
 in respect of credit risk concentrations

september 2000
 and  more detailed guidance in  appendix to  paper
        32
13            in  course of ir activities
 supervisors should assess  extent of a banks          credit risk concentrations
 how y are managed
 and  extent to which           bank considers m in its internal assessment of capital adequacy under pillar 2
          such assessments should include reviews of  results of a banks stress tests

      counterparty credit risk  32
14 as counterparty credit risk 
ccr
 represents a form of credit risk
 this would        include meeting this frameworks standards regarding ir approaches to stress        testing
 residual risks associated with credit risk mitigation techniques
 and        credit concentrations
 as specified in  paragraphs above
    32
15 the bank must have counterparty credit risk management policies
 processes and        systems  are conceptually sound and implemented with integrity relative to         sophistication and complexity of a firms holdings of exposures  give rise        to ccr
 a sound counterparty credit risk management framework shall include         identification
 measurement
 management
 approval and internal reporting of        ccr
    32
16 the banks risk management policies must take account of  market
 liquidity
        legal and operational risks  can be associated with ccr and
 to  extent        practicable
 interrelationships among those risks
 the bank must not undertake        business with a counterparty without assessing its creditworthiness and must take        due account of both settlement and pre-settlement credit risk
 these risks must        be managed as comprehensively as practicable at  counterparty level        
aggregating counterparty exposures with or credit exposures
 and at  firm
       wide level
    32
17 the board of directors and senior management must be actively involved in         ccr control process and must regard this as an essential aspect of  business        to which significant resources need to be devoted
 where  bank is using an        internal model for ccr
 senior management must be aware of  limitations and        assumptions of  model used and  impact se can have on  reliability        of  output
 they should also consider  uncertainties of  market        environment 
eg timing of realisation of collateral
 and operational issues 
eg        pricing feed irregularities
 and be aware of how se are reflected in  model
    32
18 in this regard
  daily reports prepared on a firms exposures to ccr must be        reviewed by a level of management with sufficient seniority and authority to        enforce both reductions of positions taken by individual credit managers or        traders and reductions in  firms overall ccr exposure
    32
19 the banks ccr management system must be used in conjunction with internal        credit and trading limits
 in this regard
 credit and trading limits must be related        to  firms risk measurement model in a manner  is consistent over time        and  is well understood by credit managers
 traders and senior management
    32
20 the measurement of ccr must include monitoring daily and intra-day usage of        credit lines
 the bank must measure current exposure gross and net of collateral        held where such measures are appropriate and meaningful 
eg over--counter
        or otc
 derivatives
 margin lending
""
 measuring and monitoring peak exposure or        potential future exposure at a confidence level chosen by  bank at both         portfolio and counterparty levels is one element of a robust limit monitoring        system
 banks must take account of large or concentrated positions
 including        concentrations by groups of related counterparties
 by industry
 by market
        customer investment strategies
 etc
    32
21 the bank must have a routine and rigorous program of stress testing in place as a        supplement to  ccr analysis based on  day-to-day output of  firms risk        measurement model
 the results of this stress testing must be reviewed        periodically by senior management and must be reflected in  ccr policies and        limits set by management and  board of directors
 where stress tests reveal        particular vulnerability to a given set of circumstances
 management should        explicitly consider appropriate risk management strategies 
eg by hedging        against  outcome
 or reducing  size of  firms exposures
""
    32
22 the bank must have a routine in place for ensuring compliance with a        documented set of internal policies
 controls and procedures concerning         operation of  ccr management system
 the firms ccr management system        must be well documented
 for example
 through a risk management manual         describes  basic principles of  risk management system and  provides        an explanation of  empirical techniques used to measure ccr
    32
23 the bank must conduct an independent review of  ccr management system        regularly through its own internal auditing process
 this review must include both         activities of  business credit and trading units and of  independent ccr        control unit
 a review of  overall ccr management process must take place at        regular intervals 
ideally not less than once a year
 and must specifically address
        at a minimum
           
1
  adequacy of  documentation of  ccr management system and             process

    32
24 a bank  receives approval to use an internal model to estimate its exposure        amount or ead for ccr exposures must monitor  appropriate risks and have        processes to adjust its estimation of expected positive exposure 
epe
 when those        risks become significant
 this includes  following
          
1
 banks must identify and manage ir exposures to specific wrong-way risk
          
2
 for exposures with a rising risk profile after one year
 banks must compare            on a regular basis  estimate of epe over one year with  epe over             life of  exposure

      32
25 when assessing an internal model used to estimate epe
 and especially for banks         receive approval to estimate  value of  alpha factor
 supervisors must         review  characteristics of  firms portfolio of exposures  give rise to         ccr
 in particular
 supervisors must consider  following characteristics
 namely
           
1
  diversification of  portfolio 
number of risk factors  portfolio is             exposed to
""
           
2
  correlation of default across counterparties

    32
26 supervisors will take appropriate action where  firms estimates of exposure or        ead under  internal models method 
imm
 or alpha do not adequately reflect        its exposure to ccr
 such action might include directing  bank to revise its        estimates

    32
29 in light of  wide range of risks arising from securitisation activities
 which can        be compounded by rapid innovation in securitisation techniques and instruments
        minimum capital requirements calculated under pillar 1 are often insufficient
 all        risks arising from securitisation
 particularly those  are not fully captured        under pillar 1
 should be addressed in a banks internal capital adequacy        assessment process 
icaap
""
 these risks include
           
1
 credit
 market
 liquidity and reputational risk of each exposure
           
2
 potential delinquencies and losses on  underlying securitised exposures
               
3
 exposures from credit lines or liquidity facilities to special purpose entities
             and           
4
 exposures from guarantees provided by monolines and or third parties
    32
30 securitisation exposures should be included in  banks management        information systems to help ensure  senior management understands         implications of such exposures for liquidity
 earnings
 risk concentration and        capital
 more specifically
 a bank should have  necessary processes in place to        capture in a timely manner updated information on securitisation transactions        including market data
 if available
 and updated performance data from         securitisation trustee or servicer
    32
31 a bank should conduct analyses of  underlying risks when investing in         structured products and must not solely rely on  external credit ratings        assigned to securitisation exposures by  credit rating agencies
 a bank should        be aware  external ratings are a useful starting point for credit analysis
 but        are no substitute for full and proper understanding of  underlying risk
        especially where ratings for certain asset classes have a short history or have been        shown to be volatile
 moreover
 a bank also should conduct credit analysis of         securitisation exposure at acquisition and on an ongoing basis
 it should also        have in place  necessary quantitative tools
 valuation models and stress tests        of sufficient sophistication to reliably assess all relevant risks
    32
32 when assessing securitisation exposures
 a bank should ensure  it fully        understands  credit quality and risk characteristics of  underlying exposures        in structured credit transactions
 including any risk concentrations
 in addition
 a        bank should review  maturity of  exposures underlying structured credit        transactions relative to  issued liabilities in order to assess potential maturity        mismatches
    32
33 a bank should track credit risk in securitisation exposures at  transaction level        and across securitisations exposures within each business line and across        business lines
 it should produce reliable measures of aggregate risk
 a bank also        should track all meaningful concentrations in securitisation exposures
 such as        name
 product or sector concentrations
 and feed this information to firm-wide        risk aggregation systems  track
 for example
 credit exposure to a particular        obligor
        32
34 a banks own assessment of risk needs to be based on a comprehensive        understanding of  structure of  securitisation transaction
 it should identify         various types of triggers
 credit events and or legal provisions  may        affect  performance of its on
"and off-balance sheet exposures and integrate             se triggers and provisions into its funding/liquidity"
 credit and balance sheet         management
 the impact of  events or triggers on a banks liquidity and         capital position should also be considered
    32
35 a bank should consider and
 where appropriate
 mark-to-market warehoused        positions
 as well as those in  pipeline
 regardless of  probability of        securitising  exposures
 it should consider scenarios which may prevent it from        securitising its assets as part of its stress testing 
as discussed in srp30
 and        identify  potential effect of such exposures on its liquidity
 earnings and capital        adequacy
    32
36 a bank should develop prudent contingency plans specifying how it would        respond to funding
 capital and or pressures  arise when access to        securitisation markets is reduced
 the contingency plans should also address how         bank would address valuation challenges for potentially illiquid positions held        for sale or for trading
 the risk measures
 stress testing results and contingency        plans should be incorporated into  banks risk management processes and its        icaap
 and should result in an appropriate level of capital under pillar 2 in excess        of  minimum requirements
    32
37 a bank  employs risk mitigation techniques should fully understand  risks        to be mitigated
  potential effects of  mitigation and wher or not         mitigation is fully effective
 this is to help ensure   bank does not        understate  true risk in its assessment of capital
 in particular
 it should        consider wher it would provide support to  securitisation structures in        stressed scenarios due to  reliance on securitisation as a funding tool
    32
38 furr to  pillar 1 principle  banks should take account of  economic        substance of transactions in ir determination of capital adequacy
 supervisory        authorities will monitor
 as appropriate
 wher banks have done so adequately
        as a result
 regulatory capital treatments for specific securitisation exposures        might differ from those specified in pillar 1 of  framework
 particularly in        instances where  general capital requirement would not adequately and        sufficiently reflect  risks to which an individual banking organisation is        exposed
      32
39 amongst or things
 supervisory authorities may review where relevant a banks        own assessment of its capital needs and how  has been reflected in         capital calculation as well as  documentation of certain transactions to           determine wher  capital requirements accord with  risk profile 
eg         substitution clauses
""
 supervisors will also review  manner in which banks have         addressed  issue of maturity mismatch in relation to retained positions in ir         economic capital calculations
 in particular
 y will be vigilant in monitoring for          structuring of maturity mismatches in transactions to artificially reduce capital         requirements
 additionally
 supervisors may review  banks economic capital         assessment of actual correlation between assets in  pool and how y have         reflected  in  calculation
 where supervisors consider  a banks         approach is not adequate
 y will take appropriate action
 such action might         include denying or reducing capital relief in  case of originated assets
 or         increasing  capital required against securitisation exposures acquired
    32
40 securitisation transactions may be carried out for purposes or than credit risk        transfer 
eg funding
""
 where this is  case
 re might still be a limited transfer        of credit risk
 however
 for an originating bank to achieve reductions in capital        requirements
  risk transfer arising from a securitisation has to be deemed        significant by  national supervisory authority
 if  risk transfer is considered        to be insufficient or non-existent
  supervisory authority can require         application of a higher capital requirement than prescribed under pillar 1 or
        alternatively
 may deny a bank from obtaining any capital relief from         securitisations
 therefore
  capital relief  can be achieved will correspond        to  amount of credit risk  is effectively transferred
 the following includes a        set of examples where supervisors may have concerns about  degree of risk        transfer
 such as retaining or repurchasing significant amounts of risk or cherry        picking  exposures to be transferred via a securitisation
    32
41 retaining or repurchasing significant securitisation exposures
 depending on         proportion of risk held by  originator
 might undermine  intent of a        securitisation to transfer credit risk
 specifically
 supervisory authorities might        expect  a significant portion of  credit risk and of  nominal value of         pool be transferred to at least one independent third party at inception and on        an ongoing basis
 where banks repurchase risk for market-making purposes
        supervisors could find it appropriate for an originator to buy part of a transaction        but not
 for example
 to repurchase a whole tranche
 supervisors would expect         where positions have been bought for market making purposes
 se        positions should be resold within an appropriate period
 reby remaining true        to  initial intention to transfer risk
        32
42 anor implication of realising only a non-significant risk transfer
 especially if        related to good quality unrated exposures
 is  both  poorer quality unrated        assets and most of  credit risk embedded in  exposures underlying            securitised transaction are likely to remain with  originator
 accordingly
 and         depending on  outcome of  supervisory review process
  supervisory         authority may increase  capital requirement for particular exposures or even         increase  overall level of capital  bank is required to hold
    32
43 as  minimum capital requirements for securitisation may not be able to        address all potential issues
 supervisory authorities are expected to consider new        features of securitisation transactions as y arise
 such assessments would        include reviewing  impact new features may have on credit risk transfer and
        where appropriate
 supervisors will be expected to take appropriate action under        pillar 2
 a pillar 1 response may be formulated to take account of market        innovations
" such a response may take  form of a set of operational        requirements and/or a specific capital treatment"
    32
44 support to a transaction
 wher contractual 
ie credit enhancements provided        at  inception of a securitised transaction
 or non-contractual 
implicit support
        can take numerous forms
 for instance
 contractual support can include over        collateralisation
 credit derivatives
 spread accounts
 contractual recourse        obligations
 subordinated notes
 credit risk mitigants provided to a specific        tranche
  subordination of fee or interest income or  deferral of margin        income
 and clean-up calls  exceed 10 percent of  initial issuance
 in        contrast to contractual credit exposures
 such as guarantees
 implicit support is a        more subtle form of exposure
 implicit support arises when a bank provides post
       sale support to a securitisation transaction in excess of any contractual obligation
        such non-contractual support exposes a bank to  risk of loss
 such as loss        arising from deterioration in  credit quality of  securitisations underlying        assets
 examples of implicit support include  purchase of deteriorating credit        risk exposures from  underlying pool
  sale of discounted credit risk        exposures into  pool of securitised credit risk exposures
  purchase of        underlying exposures at above market price or an increase in  first loss        position according to  deterioration of  underlying exposures
        32
45 the provision of implicit 
or non-contractual
 support
 as opposed to contractual        credit support 
ie credit enhancements
""
 raises significant supervisory concerns
        by providing implicit support
 a bank signals to  market  all of  risks        inherent in  securitised assets are still held by  organisation and
 in effect
        had not been transferred
 for traditional securitisation structures  provision of        implicit support undermines  clean break criteria
 which when satisfied would        allow banks to exclude  securitised assets from regulatory capital calculations
        for syntic securitisation structures
 it negates  significance of risk        transference
 by providing implicit support
 banks signal to  market             risk is still with  bank and has not in effect been transferred
 the institutions         capital calculation refore understates  true risk
 accordingly
 national         supervisors are expected to take appropriate action when a banking organisation         provides implicit support
    32
46 since  risk arising from  potential provision of implicit support is not        captured ex ante under pillar 1
 it must be considered as part of  pillar 2        process
 in addition
  processes for approving new products or strategic        initiatives should consider  potential provision of implicit support and should        be incorporated in a banks icaap
 when a bank has been found to provide        implicit support to a securitisation
 it will be required to hold capital against all of         underlying exposures associated with  structure as if y had not been        securitised
 it will also be required to disclose publicly  it was found to have        provided non-contractual support
 as well as  resulting increase in  capital        charge 
as noted above
""
 the aim is to require banks to hold capital against        exposures for which y assume  credit risk
 and to discourage m from        providing non-contractual support
    32
47 if a bank is found to have provided implicit support on more than one occasion
         bank is required to disclose its transgression publicly and national supervisors        will take appropriate action  may include
 but is not limited to
 one or more of         following
           
1
  bank may be prevented from gaining favourable capital treatment on             securitised assets for a period of time to be determined by  national             supervisor
           
2
  bank may be required to hold capital against all securitised assets as             though  bank had created a commitment to m
 by applying a             conversion factor to  risk weight of  underlying assets
           
3
 for purposes of capital calculations
  bank may be required to treat all             securitised assets as if y remained on  balance sheet
             
4
  bank may be required by its national supervisory authority to hold             regulatory capital in excess of  minimum risk-based capital ratios
    32
48 supervisors will be vigilant in determining implicit support and will take        appropriate supervisory action to mitigate  effects
 pending any investigation
         bank may be prohibited from any capital relief for planned securitisation        transactions 
moratorium
""
 national supervisory response will be aimed at        changing  banks behaviour with regard to  provision of implicit support
        and to correct market perception as to  willingness of  bank to provide        future recourse beyond contractual obligations
    32
49 as with credit risk mitigation techniques more generally
 supervisors will review         appropriateness of banks approaches to  recognition of credit protection
        in particular
 with regard to securitisations
 supervisors will review         appropriateness of protection recognised against first loss credit enhancements
        on se positions
 expected loss is less likely to be a significant element of         risk and is likely to be retained by  protection buyer through  pricing
        therefore
 supervisors will expect banks policies to take account of this in        determining ir economic capital
 where supervisors do not consider         approach to protection recognised is adequate
 y will take appropriate action
        such action may include increasing  capital requirement against a particular        transaction or class of transactions
    32
50 supervisors expect a bank not to make use of clauses  entitles it to call         securitisation transaction or  coverage of credit protection prematurely if this        would increase  banks exposure to losses or deterioration in  credit quality        of  underlying exposures
    32
51 besides  general principle stated above
 supervisors expect banks to only        execute clean-up calls for economic business purposes
 such as when  cost of        servicing  outstanding credit exposures exceeds  benefits of servicing         underlying credit exposures
    32
52 subject to national discretion
 supervisory authorities may require a review prior        to  bank exercising a call which can be expected to include consideration of
           
1
  rationale for  banks decision to exercise  call
 and           
2
  impact of  exercise of  call on  banks regulatory capital ratio
    32
53 the supervisory authority may also require  bank to enter into a follow-up        transaction
 if necessary
 depending on  banks overall risk profile
 and existing        market conditions
        32
54 date-related calls should be set at a date no earlier than  duration or         weighted average life of  underlying securitisation exposures
 accordingly
           supervisory authorities may require a minimum period to elapse before  first         possible call date can be set
 given
 for instance
  existence of up-front sunk         costs of a capital market securitisation transaction
    32
55 supervisors should review how banks internally measure
 monitor and manage        risks associated with securitisations of revolving credit facilities
 including an        assessment of  risk and likelihood of early amortisation of such transactions
        at a minimum
 supervisors should ensure  banks have implemented        reasonable methods for allocating economic capital against  economic        substance of  credit risk arising from revolving securitisations and should        expect banks to have adequate capital and liquidity contingency plans         evaluate  probability of an early amortisation occurring and address         implications of both scheduled and early amortisation
    32
56 because most early amortisation triggers are tied to excess spread levels
         factors affecting se levels should be well understood
 monitored and managed        to  extent possible 
see srp32
44 to srp32

 by         originating bank

  following factors affecting excess spread        should generally be considered

 interest payments made by borrowers on  underlying receivable balances
           
2
 or fees and charges to be paid by  underlying obligors 
eg late
            payment fees
 cash advance fees
 over-limit fees
""
           
3
 gross charge-offs
           
4
 principal payments
           
5
 recoveries on charged-off loans
           
6
 interchange income
           
7
 interest paid on investors certificates
 and           
8
 macroeconomic factors such as bankruptcy rates
 interest rate movements             and unemployment rates
        32
57 banks should consider  effects  changes in portfolio management or        business strategies may have on  levels of excess spread and on  likelihood        of an early amortisation event
 for example
 marketing strategies or underwriting        changes  result in lower finance charges or higher charge-offs might also        lower excess spread levels and increase  likelihood of an early amortisation        event
    32
58 banks should use techniques such as static pool cash collection analyses and        stress tests to better understand pool performance
 these techniques can        highlight adverse trends or potential adverse impacts
 banks should have policies        in place to respond promptly to adverse or unanticipated changes
 supervisors        will take appropriate action where y do not consider se policies adequate
        such action may include
 but is not limited to
 directing a bank to obtain a        dedicated liquidity line or increasing  banks capital requirements
    32
59 supervisors expect   sophistication of a banks system in monitoring         likelihood and risks of an early amortisation event will be commensurate with         size and complexity of  banks securitisation activities  involve early        amortisation provisions

market                                   risk practices under pillar 2
                                       market risk in pillar 2  33
1   clear policies and procedures used to determine  exposures  may be         included in
 and those  should be excluded from
  trading book for         purposes of calculating regulatory capital are critical to ensure  consistency         and integrity of firms trading book
 such policies must conform to rbc25
4
         supervisors should be satisfied   policies and procedures clearly delineate          boundaries of  firms trading book
 in compliance with  general         principles set forth in rbc25
 and consistent with  banks risk management         capabilities and practices
 supervisors should also be satisfied  transfers of         positions between banking and trading books can only occur in a very limited set         of circumstances
 a supervisor will require a firm to modify its policies and         procedures when y prove insufficient for preventing  booking in          trading book of positions  are not compliant with  general principles set         forth in rbc25
 or not consistent with  banks risk management capabilities         and practices
    33
2   prudent valuation policies and procedures form  foundation on which any         robust assessment of market risk capital adequacy should be built
 for a well         diversified portfolio consisting of highly liquid cash instruments
 and without         market concentration
  valuation of  portfolio
 combined with  minimum         quantitative standards set out in mar30
14 to mar30
17
 as revised in this         section
 may deliver sufficient capital to enable a bank
 in adverse market         conditions
 to close out or hedge its positions within 10 days in an orderly         fashion
 however
 for less well diversified portfolios
 for portfolios containing less         liquid instruments
 for portfolios with concentrations in relation to market         turnover
" and/or for portfolios which contain large numbers of positions  are         marked-to-model this is less likely to be  case"
 in such circumstances
         supervisors will consider wher a bank has sufficient capital
 to  extent re         is a shortfall  supervisor will react appropriately
" this will usually require          bank to reduce its risks and/or hold an additional amount of capital"
      33
3   a bank must ensure  it has sufficient capital to meet  minimum capital         requirements set out in mar30 and to cover  results of its stress testing         required by mar30
5
 taking into account  principles set forth in srp20
19 and         srp20
22
 supervisors will consider wher a bank has sufficient capital for se         purposes
 taking into account  nature and scale of  banks trading activities         and any or relevant factors such as valuation adjustments made by  bank
         to  extent  re is a shortfall
 or if supervisors are not satisfied with          premise upon which  banks assessment of internal market risk capital         adequacy is based
 supervisors will take  appropriate measures
" this will         usually involve requiring  bank to reduce its risk exposures and/or to hold an         additional amount of capital"
 so  its overall capital resources at least cover          pillar 1 requirements plus  result of a stress test acceptable to  supervisor
    33
4   for banks wishing to model  specific risk arising from ir trading activities
         additional criteria have been set out
" including conservatively assessing  risk         arising from less liquid positions and/or positions with limited price transparency         under realistic market scenarios"
 where supervisors consider  limited liquidity         or price transparency undermines  effectiveness of a banks model to capture          specific risk
 y will take appropriate measures
 including requiring          exclusion of positions from  banks specific risk model
 supervisors should         review  adequacy of  banks measure of  incremental risk capital charge
         where  banks approach is inadequate
  use of  standardised specific risk         charges will be required
                                       srp34                                   operational risk                                   under pillar 2
 supervisors should consider                                   wher  pillar 1 operational risk capital                                   requirement is consistent with its risk exposure                                   and peers
                                      operational risk in pillar 2  34
1   gross income
 used in  basic indicator and standardised approaches for         operational risk
 is only a proxy for  scale of operational risk exposure of a         bank and can in some cases 
eg for banks with low margins or profitability
         underestimate  need for capital for operational risk
    34
2   with reference to  committee document on principles for  sound         management of operational risk

""
  supervisor should consider         wher  capital requirement generated by  pillar 1 calculation

                                         srp35                                   compensation practices                                   compensation practices are an important                                   element of banks
risk management
 they should                                   be subject to rigorous and sustained review
                                      supervisory review of compensation practices  35
1   risk management must be embedded in  culture of a bank
 it should be a         critical focus of  chief executive officer
 chief risk officer
 chief operating         officer
 senior management
 trading desk and or business line heads and         employees in making strategic and day-to-day decisions
 for a broad and deep         risk management culture to develop and be maintained over time
 compensation         policies must not be unduly linked to short-term accounting profit generation
         compensation policies should be linked to longer-term capital preservation and          financial strength of  firm
 and should consider risk-adjusted performance         measures
 in addition
 a bank should provide adequate disclosure regarding its         compensation policies to stakeholders
 each banks board of directors and senior         management have  responsibility to mitigate  risks arising from         remuneration policies in order to ensure effective firm-wide risk management
  compensation practices at large financial institutions are one factor                     among many  contributed to  financial crisis  began in                     2007
 high short-term profits led to generous bonus payments to                     employees without adequate regard to  longer-term risks y                     imposed on ir firms
 these incentives amplified  excessive risk
                    taking  has threatened  global financial system and left firms                     with fewer resources to absorb losses as risks materialised
 the lack of                     attention to risk also contributed to  large
 in some cases extreme                     absolute level of compensation in  industry
 as a result
 to improve                     compensation practices and strengn supervision in this area
                     particularly for systemically important firms
  financial stability                     board published its principles for sound compensation practices in                     april 2009
 in addition
  basel committee published the                     compensation principles and standards assessment methodology in                     january 2010 and corporate governance principles for banks in 2015
                     these guidelines accompany this standard
      35
2   a banks board of directors must actively oversee  compensation systems         design and operation
 which should not be controlled primarily by  chief         executive officer and management team
 relevant board members and         employees must have independence and expertise in risk management and         compensation
        35
3   in addition
  board of directors must monitor and review  compensation         system to ensure  system includes adequate controls and operates as         intended
 the practical operation of  system should be regularly reviewed to         ensure compliance with policies and procedures
 compensation outcomes
 risk         measurements
 and risk outcomes should be regularly reviewed for consistency         with intentions
    35
4   staff  are engaged in  financial and risk control areas must be         independent
 have appropriate authority
 and be compensated in a manner          is independent of  business areas y oversee and commensurate with ir         key role in  firm
 effective independence and appropriate authority of such         staff is necessary to preserve  integrity of financial and risk managements         influence on incentive compensation
    35
5   compensation must be adjusted for all types of risk so  remuneration is         balanced between  profit earned and  degree of risk assumed in         generating  profit
 in general
 both quantitative measures and human         judgment should play a role in determining  appropriate risk adjustments
         including those  are difficult to measure such as liquidity risk and reputation         risk
    35
6   compensation outcomes must be symmetric with risk outcomes and         compensation systems should link  size of  bonus pool to  overall         performance of  firm
 employees incentive payments should be linked to          contribution of  individual and business to  firms overall performance
    35
7   compensation payout schedules must be sensitive to  time horizon of risks
         profits and losses of different activities of a financial firm are realised over         different periods of time
 variable compensation payments should be deferred         accordingly
 payments should not be finalised over short periods where risks are         realised over long periods
 management should question payouts for income          cannot be realised or whose likelihood of realisation remains uncertain at          time of payout
    35
8   the mix of cash
 equity and or forms of compensation must be consistent with         risk alignment
 the mix will vary depending on  employees position and role
         the firm should be able to explain  rationale for its mix
        35
9   supervisory review of compensation practices must be rigorous and sustained
         and deficiencies must be addressed promptly with  appropriate supervisory         action
 supervisors should include compensation practices in ir risk         assessment of firms
 and firms should work constructively with supervisors to         ensure ir practices are adequate
 regulations and supervisory practices will                 naturally differ across jurisdictions and potentially among authorities within a         country
 neverless
 all supervisors should strive for effective review and         intervention

                                       objectives  36
1   this chapter presents a set of principles to strengn banks risk data         aggregation capabilities and internal risk reporting practices 
 principles
""
 the         principles are expected to support a banks efforts to
           
1
 enhance  infrastructure for reporting key information
 particularly              used by  board and senior management to identify
 monitor and manage             risks
           
2
 improve  decision-making process throughout  banking organisation
           
3
 enhance  management of information across legal entities
 while             facilitating a comprehensive assessment of risk exposures at  global             consolidated level
           
4
 reduce  probability and severity of losses resulting from risk management             weaknesses
           
5
 improve  speed at which information is available and hence decisions can             be made
 and           
6
 improve  organisations quality of strategic planning and  ability to             manage  risk of new products and services
    36
2   strong risk management capabilities are an integral part of  franchise value of         a bank
 effective implementation of  principles should increase  value of          bank
 the committee believes   long-term benefits of improved risk         data aggregation capabilities and risk reporting practices will outweigh          investment costs incurred by banks
    36
3   for bank supervisors
 se principles will complement or efforts to improve          intensity and effectiveness of bank supervision
 for resolution authorities
         improved risk data aggregation should enable smoor bank resolution
 reby         reducing  potential recourse to taxpayers
      scope and general provisions  36
4   these principles apply to systemically important banks 
sibs
 and apply at both          banking group and on a solo basis
        36
5   the principles and supervisory expectations contained in srp36 apply to a banks         risk management data
 this includes data  is critical to enabling  bank to         manage  risks it faces
" risk data and reports should provide management with          ability to monitor and track risks relative to  banks risk tolerance/appetite"
    36
6   these principles also apply to all key internal risk management models
 including         but not limited to
 pillar 1 regulatory capital models 
eg internal ratings-based         approaches for credit risk and advanced measurement approaches for         operational risk
""
 pillar 2 capital models and or key risk management models         
eg value-at-risk
""
    36
7   the principles apply to a banks group risk management processes
 however
         banks may also benefit from applying  principles to or processes
 such as         financial and operational processes
 as well as supervisory reporting
    36
8   all  principles are also applicable to processes  have been outsourced to         third parties
    36
9   the principles cover four closely related topics
           
1
 overarching governance and infrastructure 
principles 1 and 2
           
2
 risk data aggregation capabilities

principles 12
 13 and 14
    36
10 risk data aggregation capabilities and risk reporting practices are considered        separately in this paper
 but y are clearly inter-linked and cannot exist in        isolation
 high quality risk management reports rely on  existence of strong        risk data aggregation capabilities
 and sound infrastructure and governance        ensures  information flow from one to  or
    36
11 banks should meet all risk data aggregation and risk reporting principles        simultaneously
 however
" trade-offs among principles could be accepted in        exceptional circumstances such as urgent/ad hoc requests of information on new        or unknown areas of risk"
 there should be no trade-offs  materially impact        risk management decisions
 decision-makers at banks
 in particular  board and        senior management
 should be aware of se trade-offs and  limitations or        shortcomings associated with m
 supervisors expect banks to have policies        and processes in place regarding  application of trade-offs
 banks should be        able to explain  impact of se trade-offs on ir decision-making process        through qualitative reports and
 to  extent possible
 quantitative measures
      36
12 a bank should have in place a strong governance framework
 risk data        architecture and information technology 
it
 infrastructure
 these are         preconditions to ensure compliance with  or principles included in this         chapter
 in particular
 a banks board should oversee senior managements         ownership of implementing all  risk data aggregation and risk reporting         principles and  strategy to meet m within a timeframe agreed with ir         supervisors
    36
13 the concept of materiality used in srp36 means  data and reports can        exceptionally exclude information only if it does not affect  decision-making        process in a bank 
ie decision-makers
 in particular  board and senior        management
 would have been influenced by  omitted information or made a        different judgment if  correct information had been known
""
 in applying         materiality concept
 banks will take into account considerations  go beyond         number or size of  exposures not included
 such as  type of risks        involved
 or  evolving and dynamic nature of  banking business
 banks        should also take into account  potential future impact of  information        excluded on  decision-making process at ir institutions
 supervisors expect        banks to be able to explain  omissions of information as a result of applying         materiality concept
    36
"14 banks should develop forward looking reporting capabilities to provide early        warnings of any potential breaches of risk limits  may exceed  banks risk        tolerance/appetite"
 these risk reporting capabilities should also allow banks to        conduct a flexible and effective stress testing which is capable of providing        forward-looking risk assessments
 supervisors expect risk management reports to        enable banks to anticipate problems and provide a forward looking assessment        of risk
    36
15 expert judgment may occasionally be applied to incomplete data to facilitate         aggregation process
 as well as  interpretation of results within  risk        reporting process
 reliance on expert judgment in place of complete and        accurate data should occur only on an exception basis
 and should not materially        impact  banks compliance with  principles
 when expert judgment is        applied
 supervisors expect   process be clearly documented and        transparent so as to allow for an independent review of  process followed and         criteria used in  decision-making process
        definitions  36
16 for  purpose of srp36
  term risk data aggregation means defining
"        garing and processing risk data according to  banks risk reporting        requirements to enable  bank to measure its performance against its risk        tolerance/appetite"
 this includes sorting
 merging or breaking down sets of data
    36
17 in this chapter
  following terms should be interpreted as follows
           
1
 accuracy means closeness of agreement between a measurement or             record or representation and  value to be measured
 recorded or             represented
 this definition applies to both risk data aggregation and risk             reports
           
2
 adaptability means  ability of risk data aggregation capabilities to             change 
or be changed
 in response to changed circumstances 
internal or             external

 given its business              and obligations to stakeholders
 it is generally expressed through both              quantitative and qualitative means
           
14
 timeliness means  availability of aggregated risk data within such a              timeframe as to enable a bank to produce risk reports at an established              frequency

      summary of  principles  36
18 the principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting are        summarised as follows
           
1
 governance 
a banks risk data aggregation capabilities and risk reporting             practices should be subject to strong governance arrangements consistent             with or principles and guidance established by  basel committee
           
2
 data architecture and it infrastructure  a bank should design
 build and             maintain data architecture and it infrastructure which fully supports its risk             data aggregation capabilities and risk reporting practices not only in normal             times but also during times of stress or crisis
 while still meeting  or             principles
           
3
" accuracy and integrity  a bank should be able to generate accurate and             reliable risk data to meet normal and stress/crisis reporting accuracy             requirements"
 data should be aggregated on a largely automated basis so as             to minimise  probability of errors
           
4
 completeness  a bank should be able to capture and aggregate all material             risk data across  banking group
 data should be available by business             line
 legal entity
 asset type
 industry
 region and or groupings
 as relevant             for  risk in question
  permit identifying and reporting risk exposures
             concentrations and emerging risks
         
5
 timeliness  a bank should be able to generate aggregate and up-to-date           risk data in a timely manner while also meeting  principles relating to           accuracy and integrity
 completeness and adaptability
 the precise timing will           depend upon  nature and potential volatility of  risk being measured           as well as its criticality to  overall risk profile of  bank
 the precise           timing will also depend on  bank-specific frequency requirements for risk           management reporting
" under both normal and stress/crisis situations"
 set           based on  characteristics and overall risk profile of  bank
         
6
 adaptability  a bank should be able to generate aggregate risk data to           meet a broad range of on-demand
 ad hoc risk management reporting           requests
" including requests during stress/crisis situations"
 requests due to           changing internal needs and requests to meet supervisory queries
         
7
 accuracy  risk management reports should accurately and precisely convey           aggregated risk data and reflect risk in an exact manner
 reports should be           reconciled and validated
         
8
 comprehensiveness  risk management reports should cover all material risk           areas within  organisation
 the depth and scope of se reports should           be consistent with  size and complexity of  banks operations and risk           profile
 as well as  requirements of  recipients
         
9
 clarity and usefulness  risk management reports should communicate           information in a clear and concise manner
 reports should be easy to           understand yet comprehensive enough to facilitate informed decision
          making
 reports should include an appropriate balance between risk data
           analysis and interpretation
 and qualitative explanations
 reports should           include meaningful information tailored to  needs of  recipients
         
10
 frequency  the board and senior management 
or or recipients as            appropriate
 should set  frequency of risk management report            production and distribution
 frequency requirements should reflect             needs of  recipients
  nature of  risk reported
 and  speed at            which  risk can change
 as well as  importance of reports in            contributing to sound risk management and effective and efficient decision
           making across  bank
" the frequency of reports should be increased            during times of stress/crisis"
         
11
 distribution  risk management reports should be distributed to             relevant parties and while ensuring confidentiality is maintained
         
12
 supervisory review  supervisors should periodically review and evaluate a            banks compliance with  eleven principles above
             
13
 remedial actions and supervisory measures  supervisors should have and              use  appropriate tools and resources to require effective and timely              remedial action by a bank to address deficiencies in its risk data              aggregation capabilities and risk reporting practices
 supervisors should              have  ability to use a range of tools
 including pillar 2
           
14
" home/host cooperation  supervisors should cooperate with relevant              supervisors in or jurisdictions regarding  supervision and review of               principles"
 and  implementation of any remedial action if necessary

21 a banks risk data aggregation capabilities and risk reporting practices should be
             
1
 fully documented and subject to high standards of validation
 this validation           should be independent and review  banks compliance with  principles           in this document
 the primary purpose of  independent validation is to           ensure  a bank  risk data aggregation and reporting processes are           functioning as intended and are appropriate for  bank  risk profile
           independent validation activities should be aligned and integrated with            or independent review activities within  bank  risk management           program
 and encompass all components of  bank  risk data           aggregation and reporting processes
 common practices suggest             independent validation of risk data aggregation and risk reporting practices           should be conducted using staff with specific it

 as well as broader process and it           change initiatives
 when considering a material acquisition
 a banks due           diligence process should assess  risk data aggregation capabilities and           risk reporting practices of  acquired entity
 as well as  impact on its           own risk data aggregation capabilities and risk reporting practices
 the           impact on risk data aggregation should be considered explicitly by  board           and inform  decision to proceed
 the bank should establish a timeframe           to integrate and align  acquired risk data aggregation capabilities and risk           reporting practices within its own framework
         
3
 unaffected by  banks group structure
 the group structure should not           hinder risk data aggregation capabilities at a consolidated level or at any           relevant level within  organisation 
eg sub-consolidated level
 jurisdiction           of operation level
""
 in particular
 risk data aggregation capabilities should be           independent from  choices a bank makes regarding its legal organisation           and geographical presence
       in particular  so-called second line of defence within  banks                   internal control system

 kept               current and aligned with  data definitions
 and also ensuring  risk data         aggregation capabilities and risk reporting practices are consistent with firms         policies
      principle 3  accuracy and integrity  36
27 a bank should aggregate risk data in a way  is accurate and reliable
           
1
 controls surrounding risk data should be as robust as those applicable to             accounting data
           
2
 where a bank relies on manual processes and desktop applications 
eg             spreadsheets
 databases
 and has specific risk units  use se             applications for software development
 it should have effective mitigants in             place 
eg end-user computing policies and procedures
 and or effective             controls  are consistently applied across  banks processes
           
3
 risk data should be reconciled with banks sources
 including accounting             data where appropriate
 to ensure   risk data is accurate
           
4
 a bank should strive towards a single authoritative source for risk data per             each type of risk
           
5
 a banks risk personnel should have sufficient access to risk data to ensure             y can appropriately aggregate
 validate and reconcile  data to risk             reports
    36
28 as a precondition
 a bank should have a dictionary of  concepts used
 such         data is defined consistently across an organisation
    36
29 there should be an appropriate balance between automated and manual        systems
 where professional judgements are required
 human intervention may        be appropriate
 for many or processes
 a higher degree of automation is        desirable to reduce  risk of errors
      36
30 supervisors expect banks to document and explain all of ir risk data        aggregation processes wher automated or manual 
judgment-based or           orwise
""
 documentation should include an explanation of  appropriateness         of any manual workarounds
 a description of ir criticality to  accuracy of         risk data aggregation and proposed actions to reduce  impact
    36
31 supervisors expect banks to measure and monitor  accuracy of data and to        develop appropriate escalation channels and action plans to be in place to rectify        poor data quality
      principle 4  completeness  36
32 a banks risk data aggregation capabilities should include all material risk        exposures
 including those  are off-balance sheet
    36
33 a banking organisation is not required to express all forms of risk in a common        metric or basis
 but risk data aggregation capabilities should be  same        regardless of  choice of risk aggregation systems implemented
 however
 each        system should make clear  specific approach used to aggregate exposures for        any given risk measure
 in order to allow  board and senior management to        assess  results properly
    36
34 supervisors expect banks to produce aggregated risk data  is complete and        to measure and monitor  completeness of ir risk data
 where risk data is        not entirely complete
  impact should not be critical to  banks ability to        manage its risks effectively
 supervisors expect banks data to be materially        complete
 with any exceptions identified and explained
      principle 5  timeliness  36
35 a banks risk data aggregation capabilities should ensure  it is able to        produce aggregate risk information on a timely basis to meet all risk        management reporting requirements
    36
36 the basel committee acknowledges  different types of data will be required        at different speeds
 depending on  type of risk
" and  certain risk data may        be needed faster in a stress/crisis situation"
" banks need to build ir risk systems        to be capable of producing aggregated risk data rapidly during times of stress        /crisis for all critical risks"
    36
37 critical risks include but are not limited to
             
1
 the aggregated credit exposure to a large corporate borrower
 by             comparison
 groups of retail exposures may not change as critically in a short             period of time but may still include significant concentrations
           
2
 counterparty credit risk exposures
 including
 for example

3
 trading exposures
 positions
 operating limits
 and market concentrations by             sector and region data
           
4
" liquidity risk indicators such as cash flows/settlements and funding"
 and           
5
 operational risk indicators  are time-critical 
eg systems availability
             unauthorised access

38 supervisors will review   bank specific frequency requirements
" for both        normal and stress/crisis situations"
 generate aggregate and up-to-date risk data        in a timely manner
      principle 6  adaptability  36
39 a banks risk data aggregation capabilities should be flexible and adaptable to        meet ad hoc data requests

 and           
4
 capabilities to incorporate changes in  regulatory framework
  36
41 supervisors expect banks to be able to generate subsets of data based on        requested scenarios or resulting from economic events
 for example
 a bank        should be able to aggregate risk data quickly on country credit exposures as of a               specified date based on a list of countries
 as well as industry credit exposures as         of a specified date based on a list of industry types across all business lines and         geographic areas
    including
 for instance
 sovereign
 bank
 corporate and retail exposures
        principle 7  accuracy  36
42 risk management reports should be accurate and precise to ensure a banks        board and senior management can rely with confidence on  aggregated        information to make critical decisions about risk
    36
43 to ensure  accuracy of  reports
 a bank should maintain
 at a minimum
         following
           
1
 defined requirements and processes to reconcile reports to risk data
           
2
 automated and manual edit and reasonableness checks
 including an             inventory of  validation rules  are applied to quantitative information
             the inventory should include explanations of  conventions used to             describe any mamatical or logical relationships  should be verified             through se validations or checks
 and           
3
 integrated procedures for identifying
 reporting and explaining data errors or             weaknesses in data integrity via exceptions reports
    36
44 approximations are an integral part of risk reporting and risk management
        results from models
 scenario analyses
 and stress testing are examples of        approximations  provide critical information for managing risk
 while         expectations for approximations may be different than for or types of risk        reporting
 banks should follow  reporting principles in srp36 and establish        expectations for  reliability of approximations 
accuracy
 timeliness etc
 to        ensure  management can rely with confidence on  information to make        critical decisions about risk
 this includes principles regarding data used to drive        se approximations
        36
"45          supervisors expect  a banks senior management should establish accuracy          and precision requirements for both regular and stress/crisis reporting"
 including          critical position and exposure information
 these requirements should reflect           criticality of decisions  will be based on this information
    36
46 supervisors expect banks to consider accuracy requirements analogous to        accounting materiality
 for example
 if omission or misstatement could influence         risk decisions of users
 this may be considered material
 a bank should be        able to support  rationale for accuracy requirements
 supervisors expect a        bank to consider precision requirements based on validation
 testing or        reconciliation processes and results
      principle 8  comprehensiveness  36
47 risk management reports should include exposure and position information for        all significant risk areas 
eg credit risk
 market risk
 liquidity risk
 operational risk
        and all significant components of those risk areas 
eg single name
 country and        industry sector for credit risk
""
 risk management reports should also cover risk
       related measures 
eg regulatory and economic capital
""
    36
48 reports should identify emerging risk concentrations
" provide information in         context of limits and risk appetite/tolerance and propose recommendations for        action where appropriate"
 risk reports should include  current status of        measures agreed by  board or senior management to reduce risk or deal with        specific risk situations
 this includes providing  ability to monitor emerging        trends through forward-looking forecasts and stress tests
    36
49 supervisors expect banks to determine risk reporting requirements  best suit        ir own business models and risk profiles
 supervisors will need to be satisfied        with  choices a bank makes in terms of risk coverage
 analysis and        interpretation
 scalability and comparability across group institutions
 for        example
 an aggregated risk report should include
 but not be limited to
         following information
 capital adequacy
 regulatory capital
 capital and liquidity        ratio projections
 credit risk
 market risk
 operational risk
 liquidity risk
 stress        testing results
 inter
and intra-risk concentrations
 and funding positions and        plans
    36
50 supervisors expect  risk management reports to  board and senior        management provide a forward-looking assessment of risk and should not just        rely on current and past data
 the reports should contain forecasts or scenarios        for key market variables and  effects on  bank so as to inform  board        and senior management of  likely trajectory of  banks capital and risk        profile in  future
        principle 9  clarity and usefulness  36
51 a banks risk reports should contribute to sound risk management and decision
       making by ir relevant recipients
 including
 in particular
  board and senior        management
 risk reports should ensure  information is meaningful and        tailored to  needs of  recipients
    36
52 reports should include an appropriate balance between risk data
 analysis and        interpretation
 and qualitative explanations
 the balance of qualitative versus        quantitative information will vary at different levels within  organisation and        will also depend on  level of aggregation  is applied to  reports
 higher        up in  organisation
 more aggregation is expected and refore a greater        degree of qualitative interpretation will be necessary
    36
53 reporting policies and procedures should recognise  differing information        needs of  board
 senior management
 and  or levels of  organisation        
for example risk committees
""
    36
54 as one of  key recipients of risk management reports
  banks board is        responsible for determining its own risk reporting requirements and complying        with its obligations to shareholders and or relevant stakeholders
 the board        should ensure  it is asking for and receiving relevant information  will        allow it to fulfil its governance mandate relating to  bank and  risks to        which it is exposed
" this will allow  board to ensure it is operating within its        risk tolerance/appetite"
    36
"55 the board should alert senior management when risk reports do not meet its        requirements and do not provide  right level and type of information to set        and monitor adherence to  banks risk tolerance/appetite"
 the board should        indicate wher it is receiving  right balance of detail and quantitative versus        qualitative information
    36
56 senior management is also a key recipient of risk reports and it is responsible for        determining its own risk reporting requirements
 senior management should        ensure  it is receiving relevant information  will allow it to fulfil its        management mandate relative to  bank and  risks to which it is exposed
    36
57 a bank should develop an inventory and classification of risk data items which        includes a reference to  concepts used to elaborate  reports
    36
58 supervisors expect  reports will be clear and useful
 reports should reflect an        appropriate balance between detailed data
 qualitative discussion
 explanation        and recommended conclusions
 interpretation and explanations of  data
        including observed trends
 should be clear
          36
59 supervisors expect a bank to confirm periodically with recipients          information aggregated and reported is relevant and appropriate
 in terms of        both amount and quality
 to  governance and decision-making process
      principle 10  frequency  36
60 the frequency of risk reports will vary according to  type of risk
 purpose and        recipients
" a bank should assess periodically  purpose of each report and set        requirements for how quickly  reports need to be produced in both normal        and stress/crisis situations"
 a bank should routinely test its ability to produce        accurate reports within established timeframes
" particularly in stress/crisis        situations"
    36
"61 supervisors expect  in times of stress/crisis all relevant and critical credit"
"        market and liquidity position/exposure reports are available within a very short        period of time to react effectively to evolving risks"
" some position/exposure        information may be needed immediately "
intraday
 to allow for timely and        effective reactions
      principle 11  distribution  36
62 procedures should be in place to allow for rapid collection and analysis of risk        data and timely dissemination of reports to all appropriate recipients
 this should        be balanced with  need to ensure confidentiality as appropriate
    36
63 supervisors expect a bank to confirm periodically   relevant recipients        receive timely reports
      principle 12  supervisory review  36
64 supervisors should review a banks compliance with  principles in         preceding sections
 reviews should be incorporated into  regular programme        of supervisory reviews and may be supplemented by matic reviews covering        multiple banks with respect to a single or selected issue
 supervisors may test a        banks compliance with  principles through occasional requests for        information to be provided on selected risk issues 
for example
 exposures to        certain risk factors
 within short deadlines
 reby testing  capacity of a bank        to aggregate risk data rapidly and produce risk reports
 supervisors should have        access to  appropriate reports to be able to perform this review
        36
65 supervisors should draw on reviews conducted by  internal or external        auditors to inform ir assessments of compliance with  principles
        supervisors may require work to be carried out by a banks internal audit         functions or by experts independent from  bank
 supervisors must have access         to all appropriate documents such as internal validation and audit reports
 and         should be able to meet with and discuss risk data aggregation capabilities with          external auditors or independent experts from  bank

      principle 13  remedial actions and supervisory measures  36
67 supervisors should require effective and timely remedial action by a bank to        address deficiencies in its risk data aggregation capabilities and risk reporting        practices and internal controls
    36
68 supervisors should have a range of tools at ir disposal to address material        deficiencies in a banks risk data aggregation and reporting capabilities
 such        tools may include
 but are not limited to
 requiring a bank to take remedial        action
 increasing  intensity of supervision
 requiring an independent review by        a third party
 such as external auditors
 and  possible use of capital add-ons as        both a risk mitigant and incentive under pillar 2
    36
69 supervisors should be able to set limits on a banks risks or  growth in ir        activities where deficiencies in risk data aggregation and reporting are assessed        as causing significant weaknesses in risk management capabilities

    36
71 when a supervisor requires a bank to take remedial action
  supervisor should        set a timetable for completion of  action
 supervisors should have escalation        procedures in place to require more stringent or accelerated remedial action in         event  a bank does not adequately address  deficiencies identified
 or        in  case  supervisors deem furr action is warranted
"          principle 14  home/host cooperation  36"
72 effective cooperation and appropriate information sharing between  home        and host supervisory authorities should contribute to  robustness of a banks        risk management practices across a banks operations in multiple jurisdictions
        wherever possible
 supervisors should avoid performing redundant and        uncoordinated reviews related to risk data aggregation and risk reporting
    36
73 cooperation can take  form of sharing of information within  constraints of        applicable laws
 as well as discussion between supervisors on a bilateral or        multilateral basis 
eg through colleges of supervisors
""
 including
 but not limited        to
 regular meetings
 communication by conference call and email may be        particularly useful in tracking required remedial actions
 cooperation through        colleges should be in line with  basel committees principles for effective        supervisory colleges
      36
74 supervisors should discuss ir experiences regarding  quality of risk data        aggregation capabilities and risk reporting practices in different parts of         group
 this should include any impediments to risk data aggregation and risk        reporting arising from cross-border issues and also wher risk data is        distributed appropriately across  group
 such exchanges will enable        supervisors to identify significant concerns at an early stage and to respond        promptly and effectively

 these         tools promote global consistency in supervising ongoing liquidity and funding         risk exposures of banks
 and in communicating se exposures to home and         host supervisors

2   these metrics
 toger with  lcr and nsfr standard
 provide  cornerstone         of information  aid supervisors in assessing  liquidity risk of a bank
 in         addition
 supervisors may need to supplement this framework by using additional         tools and metrics tailored to help capture elements of liquidity risk specific to         ir jurisdictions
 in utilising se metrics
 supervisors should take action when         potential liquidity difficulties are signalled through a negative trend in          metrics
 or when a deteriorating liquidity position is identified
 or when          absolute result of  metric identifies a current or potential liquidity problem
         examples of actions  supervisors can take are outlined in  committees         sound principles 
paragraphs 141-143

   the basel committees principles for sound liquidity risk                     management and supervision also contain more general guidance for                     banks and supervisors on liquidity risk management     50
3   consistent with ir broader liquidity risk management responsibilities
 bank         management will be responsible for collating and submitting  monitoring data         for  tools to ir banking supervisor
 it is recognised  banks may need to         liaise closely with counterparts
 including payment system operators and         correspondent banks
 to collate  data
 however
 banks and supervisors are not         required to disclose se reporting requirements publicly
 public disclosure is         not intended to be part of se monitoring tools
        as agreed by national authorities in a particular jurisdiction
                      monitoring data may be collected by a relevant domestic oversight                     authority 
eg payments system overseer
 instead of  banking                     supervisor
      50
4   the tools in this chapter are for monitoring purposes only
 internationally active         banks must apply se tools
 these tools may also be useful in promoting sound         liquidity management practices for or banks
 wher y are direct         participants of a large-value payment system 
lvps
 or use a correspondent         bank to settle payments
 national supervisors will determine  extent to which          tools apply to non-internationally active banks within ir jurisdictions
       direct participant means a participant in a large-value payment                     system  can settle transactions without using an intermediary
 if                     not a direct participant
 a participant will need to use  services of a                     direct participant 
a correspondent bank
 to perform particular                     settlements on its behalf
 banks can be a direct participant in a large
                    value payment system while using a correspondent bank to settle                     particular payments
 for example
 payments for an ancillary system
                     not all tools will be relevant to all reporting banks as liquidity profiles                     will differ between banks 
eg wher y access payment and                     settlement systems directly or indirectly or wher y provide                     correspondent banking services and intraday credit facilities to or                     banks

        contractual maturity mismatch  50
6   the contractual maturity mismatch profile identifies  gaps between          contractual inflows and outflows of liquidity for defined time bands
 these         maturity gaps indicate how much liquidity a bank would potentially need to raise         in each of se time bands if all outflows occurred at  earliest possible date
         this metric provides insight into  extent to which  bank relies on maturity         transformation under its current contracts
 the metric is defined as contractual         cash and security inflows and outflows from all on
and off-balance sheet items
         mapped to defined time banks based on ir respective maturities
    50
7   a bank should report contractual cash and security flows in  relevant time         bands based on ir residual contractual maturity
 supervisors in each         jurisdiction will determine  specific template
 including required time bands
         by which data must be reported
 supervisors should define  time buckets so         as to be able to understand  banks cash flow position
 possibilities include         requesting  cash flow mismatch to be constructed for  overnight

 5 and beyond 5 years buckets
 instruments          have no specific maturity 
non-defined or open maturity
 should be reported         separately
 with details on  instruments
 and with no assumptions applied as         to when maturity occurs
 information on possible cash flows arising from         derivatives such as interest rate swaps and options should also be included to          extent  ir contractual maturities are relevant to  understanding of          cash flows
        50
8   at a minimum
  data collected from  contractual maturity mismatch should         provide data on  categories outlined in  lcr
 some additional accounting         
non-dated
 information such as capital or non-performing loans may need to be         reported separately
    50
9   the following assumptions should be made with regard to contractual cash flows
           
1
 no rollover of existing liabilities is assumed to take place
 for assets
              bank is assumed not to enter into any new contracts
           
2
 contingent liability exposures  would require a change in  state of              world 
such as contracts with triggers based on a change in prices of             financial instruments or a downgrade in  bank  credit rating
 need to be             detailed
 grouped by what would trigger  liability
 with  respective             exposures clearly identified
           
3
 a bank should record all securities flows
" this will allow supervisors to             monitor securities movements  mirror corresponding cash flows as well             as  contractual maturity of collateral swaps and any uncollateralised stock             lending/borrowing where stock movements occur without any             corresponding cash flows"
           
4
 a bank should report separately  customer collateral received               bank is permitted to rehypocate as well as  amount of such collateral              is rehypocated at each reporting date
 this also will highlight             instances when  bank is generating mismatches in  borrowing and             lending of customer collateral
    50
10 banks will provide  raw data to  supervisors
 with no assumptions included        in  data
 standardised contractual data submission by banks enables        supervisors to build a market-wide view and identify market outliers vis--vis        liquidity
    50
11 given   metric is based solely on contractual maturities with no        behavioural assumptions
  data will not reflect actual future forecasted flows        under  current
 or future
 strategy or plans
 ie
 under a going-concern view
        also
 contractual maturity mismatches do not capture outflows  a bank may        make in order to protect its franchise
 even where contractually re is no        obligation to do so
 for analysis
 supervisors can apply ir own assumptions to        reflect alternative behavioural responses in reviewing maturity gaps
      50
12 as outlined in  sound principles
 banks should also conduct ir own maturity        mismatch analyses
 based on going-concern behavioural assumptions of         inflows and outflows of funds in both normal situations and under stress
 these        analyses should be based on strategic and business plans and should be shared        and discussed with supervisors
 and  data provided in  contractual maturity           mismatch should be utilised as a basis of comparison
 when firms are         contemplating material changes to ir business models
 it is crucial for         supervisors to request projected mismatch reports as part of an assessment of         impact of such changes to prudential supervision
 examples of such changes         include potential major acquisitions or mergers or  launch of new products          have not yet been contractually entered into
 in assessing such data         supervisors need to be mindful of assumptions underpinning  projected         mismatches and wher y are prudent
    50
13 a bank should be able to indicate how it plans to bridge any identified gaps in its        internally generated maturity mismatches and explain why  assumptions        applied differ from  contractual terms
 the supervisor should challenge se        explanations and assess  feasibility of  banks funding plans
      concentration of funding  50
14 this metric is meant to identify those sources of wholesale funding  are of        such significance  withdrawal of this funding could trigger liquidity problems
        the metric thus encourages  diversification of funding sources recommended        in  committees sound principles
 it is defined as follows
           
1
 funding liabilities sourced from each significant counterparty as a % of total             liabilities           
2
" funding liabilities sourced from each significant production / instrument as a             % of total liabilities           "

1
 and srp50
14
2
" is determined by examining        funding concentrations by counterparty or type of instrument/product"
 banks and        supervisors should monitor both  absolute percentage of  funding        exposure
 as well as significant increases in concentrations
    50
16 the numerator for counterparties is calculated by aggregating  total of all        types of liabilities to a single counterparty or group of connected or affiliated        counterparties
 as well as all or direct borrowings
 both secured and        unsecured
 which  bank can determine arise from  same counterparty

""
          for some funding sources
 such as debt issues  are transferable                     across counterparties 
"such as cp/cd funding dated longer than                     overnight"
 etc
""
 it is not always possible to identify  counterparty                     holding  debt
      50
17 a significant counterparty is defined as a single counterparty or group of        connected or affiliated counterparties accounting in aggregate for more than 1%        of  bank  total balance sheet
 although in some cases re may be or        defining characteristics based on  funding profile of  bank
 a group of        connected counterparties is
 in this context
 defined in  same way as in         large exposure regulation of  host country in  case of consolidated        reporting for solvency purposes
 intra-group deposits and deposits from related        parties should be identified specifically under this metric
 regardless of wher         metric is being calculated at a legal entity or group level
 due to  potential        limitations to intra-group transactions in stressed conditions
    50
"18 the numerator for type of instrument/product should be calculated for each        individually significant funding instrument/product"
" as well as by calculating        groups of similar types of instruments/products"
    50
"19 a significant instrument/product is defined as a single instrument/product or        group of similar instruments/products  in aggregate amount to more than        1% of  bank  total balance sheet"
    50
20 in order to capture  amount of structural currency mismatch in a banks assets        and liabilities
 banks are required to provide a list of  amount of assets and        liabilities in each significant currency
    50
21 a currency is considered significant if  aggregate liabilities denominated in         currency amount to 5% or more of  bank  total liabilities
    50
22 the above metrics should be reported separately for  time horizons of less        than one month
 1-3 months
 3-6 months
 6-12 months
 and for longer than 12        months
        50
23 in utilising this metric to determine  extent of funding concentration to a        certain counterparty
 both  bank and supervisors must recognise  currently        it is not possible to identify  actual funding counterparty for many types of        debt
 the actual concentration of funding sources
 refore
 could likely be        higher than this metric indicates
 the list of significant counterparties could        change frequently
 particularly during a crisis
 supervisors should consider         potential for herding behaviour on  part of funding counterparties in  case        of an institution-specific problem
 in addition
 under market-wide stress
 multiple         funding counterparties and  bank itself may experience concurrent liquidity         pressures
 making it difficult to sustain funding
 even if sources appear well         diversified
    for some funding sources
 such as debt issues  are transferable                     across counterparties 
"such as cp/cd funding dated longer than                     overnight"
 etc
""
 it is not always possible to identify  counterparty                     holding  debt      50
24 in interpreting this metric
 one must recognise   existence of bilateral        funding transactions may affect  strength of commercial ties and  amount        of  net outflow
9             footnotes         9           eg where  monitored institution also extends funding or has large                     unused credit lines outstanding to  significant counterparty
      50
25 these metrics do not indicate how difficult it would be to replace funding from        any given source
    50
26 to capture potential foreign exchange risks
  comparison of  amount of        assets and liabilities by currency will provide supervisors with a baseline for        discussions with  banks about how y manage any currency mismatches        through swaps
 forwards
 etc
 it is meant to provide a base for furr discussions        with  bank rar than to provide a snapshot view of  potential risk

27 these metrics provide supervisors with data on  quantity and key        characteristics
 including currency denomination and location
 of banks available        unencumbered assets
 these assets have  potential to be used as collateral to        raise additional high-quality liquid assets 
hqla
 or secured funding in secondary        markets or are eligible at central banks and as such may potentially be additional        sources of liquidity for  bank
 the metrics are defined as
           
1
 available unencumbered assets  are marketable as collateral in secondary             markets
 and           
2
 available unencumbered assets  are eligible for central banks standing             facilities
    50
28 a bank is to report  amount
 type and location of available unencumbered        assets  could serve as collateral for secured borrowing in secondary markets        at prearranged or current haircuts at reasonable costs
    50
29 likewise
 a bank should report  amount
 type and location of available        unencumbered assets  are eligible for secured financing with relevant central        banks at prearranged 
if available
 or current haircuts at reasonable costs
 for        standing facilities only 
ie excluding emergency assistance arrangements
""
 this        would include collateral  has already been accepted at  central bank but        remains unused
 for assets to be counted in this metric
  bank must have        already put in place  operational procedures  would be needed to        monetise  collateral
    50
30 a bank should report separately  customer collateral received   bank is        permitted to deliver or re-pledge
 as well as  part of such collateral  it is        delivering or re-pledging at each reporting date
    50
31 in addition to providing  total amounts available
 a bank should report se        items categorised by significant currency
 a currency is considered significant if         aggregate stock of available unencumbered collateral denominated in         currency amounts 5% or more of  associated total amount of available        unencumbered collateral 
for secondary markets or central banks
""
    50
32 in addition
 a bank must report  estimated haircut   secondary market        or relevant central bank would require for each asset
 in  case of  latter
 a        bank would be expected to reference
 under business as usual
  haircut        required by  central bank  it would normally access 
which likely involves        matching funding currency  eg european central bank for euro-denominated        funding
 bank of japan for yen funding
 etc
""
      50
33 as a second step after reporting  relevant haircuts
 a bank should report         expected monetised value of  collateral 
rar than  notional amount
 and        where  assets are actually held
 in terms of  location of  assets and what        business lines have access to those assets
    50
34 these metrics are useful for examining  potential for a bank to generate an        additional source of hqla or secured funding
 they will provide a standardised        measure of  extent to which  lcr can be quickly replenished after a        liquidity shock eir via raising funds in private markets or utilising central bank        standing facilities
 the metrics do not
 however
 capture potential changes in        counterparties haircuts and lending policies  could occur under eir a        systemic or idiosyncratic event and could provide false comfort          estimated monetised value of available unencumbered collateral is greater than it        would be when it is most needed
 supervisors should keep in mind  se        metrics do not compare available unencumbered assets to  amount of        outstanding secured funding or any or balance sheet scaling factor
 to gain a        more complete picture
  information generated by se metrics should be        complemented with  maturity mismatch metric and or balance sheet data
      lcr by significant currency  50
35 while  lcr is required to be met in one single currency
 in order to better        capture potential currency mismatches
 banks and supervisors should also        monitor  lcr in significant currencies
 this will allow  bank and         supervisor to track potential currency mismatch issues  could arise
 this        metric is defined as follows
     amount of total net foreign exchange cash outflows should be net of                     foreign exchange hedges
      50
36 the definition of  stock of high-quality foreign exchange assets and total net        foreign exchange cash outflows should mirror those of  lcr for common        currencies
  cash flows from assets
 liabilities and off-balance sheet items will be                     computed in  currency   counterparties are obliged to deliver                     to settle  contract
 independent of  currency to which                      contract is indexed 
"or ""linked"""
""
 or  currency whose fluctuation it is                     intended to hedge
      50
37 a currency is considered significant if  aggregate liabilities denominated in         currency amount to 5% or more of  bank  total liabilities
    50
38 as  foreign currency lcr is not a minimum requirement but a monitoring tool
        it does not have an internationally defined minimum required threshold
        noneless
 supervisors in each jurisdiction could set minimum monitoring        ratios for  foreign exchange lcr
 below which a supervisor should be alerted
        in this case
  ratio at which supervisors should be alerted would depend on         stress assumption
 supervisors should evaluate banks ability to raise funds in        foreign currency markets and  ability to transfer a liquidity surplus from one        currency to anor and across jurisdictions and legal entities
 therefore
  ratio        should be higher for currencies in which  supervisors evaluate a banks ability        to raise funds in foreign currency markets or  ability to transfer a liquidity        surplus from one currency to anor and across jurisdictions and legal entities to        be limited
    50
39 this metric is meant to allow  bank and supervisor to track potential currency        mismatch issues  could arise in a time of stress
      market-related monitoring tools  50
40 high-frequency market data with little or no time lag can be used as early        warning indicators in monitoring potential liquidity difficulties at banks
    50
41 while re are many types of data available in  market
 supervisors can        monitor data at  following levels to focus on potential liquidity difficulties
           
1
 market-wide information
           
2
 information on  financial sector
 and           
3
 bank-specific information
    50
42 supervisors can monitor information both on  absolute level and direction of        major markets and consider ir potential impact on  financial sector and         specific bank
 market-wide information is also crucial when evaluating        assumptions behind a banks funding plan
          50
43 valuable market information to monitor includes
 but is not limited to
 equity        prices 
ie overall stock markets and sub-indices in various jurisdictions relevant to         activities of  supervised banks
""
 debt markets 
money markets
 medium
       term notes
 long term debt
 derivatives
 government bond markets
 credit default        spread indices
 etc
""
 foreign exchange markets
 commodities markets
 and indices        related to specific products
 such as for certain securitised products 
eg  abx        asset-backed securities index
""
    50
44 to track wher  financial sector as a whole is mirroring broader market        movements or is experiencing difficulties
 information to be monitored includes        equity and debt market information for  financial sector broadly and for        specific subsets of  financial sector
 including indices
    50
45 to monitor wher  market is losing confidence in a particular institution or        has identified risks at an institution
 it is useful to collect information on equity        prices
 credit default swap 
cds
 spreads
 money-market trading prices
         situation of roll-overs and prices for various lengths of funding
"  price/yield of        bank debenture or subordinated debt in  secondary market"
    50
46 information such as equity prices and credit spreads are readily available
        however
  accurate interpretation of such information is important
 for        instance
  same cds spread in numerical terms may not necessarily imply         same risk across markets due to market-specific conditions such as low market        liquidity
 also
 when considering  liquidity impact of changes in certain data        points
  reaction of or market participants to such information can be        different
 as various liquidity providers may emphasise different types of data
      monitoring tools for intraday liquidity management  50
47 a banks failure to effectively manage intraday liquidity could leave it unable to        meet its payment and settlement obligations on a timely basis
 which could lead        to liquidity dislocations  cascade quickly across many systems and        institutions
 as such
  banks management of intraday liquidity risk should be        considered as a crucial part of liquidity risk management
 it should also actively        manage its collateral positions and have  ability to calculate all of its collateral        positions
    50
48 for  purpose of this chapter
  following definitions will apply to  terms        stated below
           
1
 intraday liquidity
 funds which can be accessed during  business day
             usually to enable banks to make payments in real time
             
2
 business day
  opening hours of  lvps or of correspondent banking             services during which a bank can receive and make payments in a local             jurisdiction
           
3
 intraday liquidity risk
  risk  a bank fails to manage its intraday             liquidity effectively
 which could leave it unable to meet a payment             obligation at  time expected
 reby affecting its own liquidity position             and  of or parties
 and           
4
 time-specific obligations
 obligations which must be settled at a specific time             within  day or have an expected intraday settlement deadline

50 in correspondent banking
 some customer payments are made across accounts        held by  same correspondent bank
 these payments do not give rise to an        intraday liquidity source or usage for  correspondent bank as y do not link        to  payment and settlement systems
 however
 se internalised payments        do have intraday liquidity implications for both  sending and receiving        customer banks and should be incorporated in ir reporting of  monitoring        tools
      summary of  intraday liquidity monitoring tools    50
51 a number of factors influence a banks usage of intraday liquidity in payment and        settlement systems and its vulnerability to intraday liquidity shocks
 as such
 no        single monitoring tool can provide supervisors with sufficient information to        identify and monitor  intraday liquidity risk run by a bank
 to achieve this
        seven separate monitoring tools have been developed 
see table 1
""
 as not all of         tools will be relevant to all reporting banks
  tools have been classified in        three groups to determine ir applicability as follows
           
1

 applicable to all reporting banks
           
2

     intraday throughput          scope of application of  intraday liquidity monitoring tools    50
52 banks generally manage ir intraday liquidity risk on a system-by-system basis        in a single currency
 but it is recognised  practices differ across banks and        jurisdictions
 depending on  institutional set up of a bank and  specifics of         systems in which it operates
 the following considerations aim to help banks        and supervisors determine  most appropriate way to apply  tools
 should        banks need furr clarification
 y should discuss  scope of application with        ir supervisors
        50
53 banks which are direct participants to an lvps can manage ir intraday liquidity        in very different ways
 some banks manage ir payment and settlement activity        on a system-by-system basis
 ors make use of direct intraday liquidity        bridges between lvps
 which allow excess liquidity to be transferred from one               system to anor without restriction
 or formal arrangements exist
 which         allow funds to be transferred from one system to anor 
such as agreements         for foreign currency liquidity to be used as collateral for domestic systems
""
      a direct intraday liquidity bridge is a technical functionality built into                     two or more lvps  allows banks to make transfers directly from                     one system to  or intraday
      50
54 to allow for se different approaches
 direct participants should apply a        bottom-up approach to determine  appropriate basis for reporting         monitoring tools
 the following sets out  principles which such banks should        follow
           
1
 as a baseline
 individual banks should report on each lvps in which y             participate on a system-by-system-basis
           
2
 if re is a direct real-time technical liquidity bridge between two or more             lvps
  intraday liquidity in those systems may be considered fungible
 at             least one of  linked lvps may refore be considered an ancillary system             for  purpose of  tools
           
3
 if a bank can demonstrate to  satisfaction of its supervisor  it regularly             monitors positions and uses or formal arrangements to transfer liquidity             intraday between lvps which do not have a direct technical liquidity bridge
             those lvps may also be considered as ancillary systems for reporting             purposes
    50
55 ancillary systems 
eg retail payment systems
 cls
 some securities settlement        systems and central counterparties
""
 place demands on a banks intraday liquidity        when se systems settle  banks obligations in an lvps
 consequently
        separate reporting requirements will not be necessary for such ancillary systems
    50
56 banks  use correspondent banking services should base ir reports on         payment and settlement activity over ir account
s
 with ir correspondent        bank
s
""
 where more than one correspondent bank is used
  bank should        report per correspondent bank
 for banks which access an lvps indirectly           through more than one correspondent bank
  reporting may be aggregated
         provided   reporting bank can demonstrate to  satisfaction of its         supervisor  it is able to move liquidity between its correspondent banks
    50
57 banks which operate as direct participants of an lvps but which also make use of        correspondent banks should discuss wher y can aggregate se for        reporting purposes with ir supervisor
 aggregation may be appropriate if         payments made directly through  lvps and those made through         correspondent bank
s
 are in  same jurisdiction and same currency
    50
58 banks  manage ir intraday liquidity on a currency-by-currency basis should        report on an individual currency basis
    50
59 if a bank can prove to  satisfaction of its supervisor  it manages liquidity        on a cross-currency basis and has  ability to transfer funds intraday with        minimal delay  including in periods of acute stress  n  intraday liquidity        positions across currencies may be aggregated for reporting purposes
 however
        banks should also report at an individual currency level so  supervisors can        monitor  extent to which firms are reliant on foreign exchange swap markets
    50
60 when  level of activity of a banks payment and settlement activity in any one        particular currency is considered de minimis
 with  agreement of         supervisor
 a reporting exemption could apply and separate returns need not        be submitted
       as an indicative threshold
 supervisors may consider  a currency is                     considered significant if  aggregate liabilities denominated in                      currency amount to 5% or more of  bank  total liabilities
 see                     srp50
37
      50
61 the appropriate organisational level for each banks reporting of its intraday        liquidity data should be determined by  supervisor
 but it is expected          monitoring tools will typically be applied at a significant individual legal entity        level
 the decision on  appropriate entity should consider any potential        impediments to moving intraday liquidity between entities within a group
        including  ability of supervisory jurisdictions to ring-fence liquid assets
 timing        differences and any logistical constraints on  movement of collateral
      50
62 where re are no impediments or constraints to transferring intraday liquidity        between two 
or more
 legal entities intraday
 and banks can demonstrate this to         satisfaction of ir supervisor
  intraday liquidity requirements of         entities may be aggregated for reporting purposes

 the allocation of responsibility between home and host        supervisor will ultimately depend upon wher  bank operating in  non

67 conversely
 when a bank runs a positive net cumulative position at some point        intraday

76 the value of payments made on behalf of correspondent banking customers        tool will enable supervisors to gain a better understanding of  proportion of a        correspondent banks payment flows  arise from its provision of        correspondent banking services
 these flows may have a significant impact on         correspondent banks own intraday liquidity management

    paragraph 79 of  sound principles states 
 [t]he level of a bank                      s gross cash inflows and outflows may be uncertain

relative to total payments
  settle by        specific times during  day
 by value within each hour of  business day
        over time
 this will enable supervisors to identify any changes in a banks        payment and settlement behaviour

        intraday liquidity stress scenarios  50
82 the monitoring tools in srp50
64 to srp50
81 will provide banking supervisors        with information on a banks intraday liquidity profile in normal conditions
        however
  availability and usage of intraday liquidity can change markedly in        times of stress
 in  course of ir discussions on broader liquidity risk        management
 banks and supervisors should also consider  impact of a banks        intraday liquidity requirements in stress conditions
 as guidance
 four possible        
but non-exhaustive
 stress scenarios have been identified and are described        below
 banks should determine with ir supervisor which of  scenarios 
or        or scenarios
 are relevant to ir particular circumstances and business        model
             
1
 own financial stress
 a bank suffers
 or is perceived to be suffering from
 a           stress event
             
a
 for a direct participant
" own financial and/or operational stress may               result in counterparties deferring payments and/or withdrawing intraday               credit lines"
 this
 in turn
 may result in  bank having to fund more of               its payments from its own intraday liquidity sources to avoid having to               defer its own payments
             
b
 for banks  use correspondent banking services
 an own financial               stress may result in intraday credit lines being withdrawn by                correspondent bank
s
""
" and/or its own counterparties deferring               payments"
" this may require  bank having eir to prefund its               payments and/or to collateralise its intraday credit line"
s
""
         
2
 counterparty stress
 a major counterparty suffers an intraday stress event           which prevents it from making payments
 a counterparty stress may result in           direct participants and banks  use correspondent banking services being           unable to rely on incoming payments from  stressed counterparty
           reducing  availability of intraday liquidity  can be sourced from            receipt of  counterpartys payments
         
3
 a customers banks stress
 a customer bank of a correspondent bank suffers           a stress event
 a customer banks stress may result in or banks deferring           payments to  customer
 creating a furr loss of intraday liquidity at its           correspondent bank
               
4
 market-wide credit or liquidity stress
 this may have adverse implications for              value of liquid assets  a bank holds to meet its intraday liquidity             usage
" a widespread fall in  market value and/or credit rating of a banks             unencumbered liquid assets may constrain its ability to raise intraday             liquidity from  central bank"
 in a worst case scenario
 a material credit             downgrade of  assets may result in  assets no longer meeting              eligibility criteria for  central banks intraday liquidity facilities
                
a
 for a bank  uses correspondent banking services
" a widespread fall                  in  market value and/or credit rating of its unencumbered liquid                  assets may constrain its ability to raise intraday liquidity from its                  correspondent bank"
s
""
                
b
 banks which manage intraday liquidity on a cross-currency basis should                  consider  intraday liquidity implications of a closure of
 or                  operational difficulties in
 currency swap markets and stresses occurring                  in multiple systems simultaneously
     banks are encouraged to consider reverse stress scenarios and or                     stress testing scenarios as appropriate 
for example
  impact of                     natural disasters
 currency crisis
 etc
""
 in addition
 banks should use                     se stress testing scenarios to inform ir intraday liquidity risk                     tolerance and contingency funding plans
        application of  stress scenarios    50
83 for  own financial stress and counterparty stress
 all reporting banks should        consider  likely impact  se stress scenarios would have on ir daily        maximum intraday liquidity usage
 available intraday liquidity at  start of         business day
 total payments and time-specific obligations
    50
84 for  customer banks stress scenario
 banks  provide correspondent        banking services should consider  likely impact  this stress scenario would        have on  value of payments made on behalf of its customers and intraday        credit lines extended to its customers
    50
85 for  market-wide stress
 all reporting banks should consider  likely impact          stress would have on ir sources of available intraday liquidity at         start of  business day
        50
86 banks need not report  impact of  stress scenarios on  monitoring tools        to supervisors on a regular basis
" they should use  scenarios to assess how         ir intraday liquidity profile in normal conditions would change in conditions of         stress and discuss with ir supervisor how any adverse impact would be         addressed eir through contingency planning arrangements and/or ir wider         intraday liquidity risk management framework"
    50
87 while each of  monitoring tools has value in itself
 combining  information        provided by  tools will give supervisors a comprehensive view of a banks        resilience to intraday liquidity shocks
 the following is a non-exhaustive set of        examples which illustrate how  tools could be used in different combinations        by banking supervisors to assess a banks resilience to intraday liquidity risk
           
1
 time-specific obligations relative to total payments and available intraday             liquidity at  start of  business day
 if a high proportion of a banks             payment activity is time critical
  bank has less flexibility to deal with             unexpected shocks by managing its payment flows
 especially when its             amount of available intraday liquidity at  start of  business day is             typically low
 in such circumstances  supervisor might expect  bank to             have adequate risk management arrangements in place or to hold a higher             proportion of unencumbered assets to mitigate this risk
           
2
 available intraday liquidity at  start of  business day relative to              impact of intraday stresses on  banks daily liquidity usage
 if  impact             of an intraday liquidity stress on a banks daily liquidity usage is large relative             to its available intraday liquidity at  start of  business day
 it suggests               bank may struggle to settle payments in a timely manner in             conditions of stress
           
3
 relationship between daily maximum liquidity usage
 available intraday             liquidity at  start of  business day and  time-specific obligations
 if a             bank misses its time-specific obligations
 it could have a significant impact             on or banks
 if it were demonstrated   banks daily liquidity usage             was high and  lowest amount of available intraday liquidity at  start of              business day were close to zero
 it might suggest   bank is             managing its payment flows with an insufficient pool of liquid assets
           
4
 total payments and value of payments made on behalf of correspondent             banking customers
 if a large proportion of a banks total payment activity is             made by a correspondent bank on behalf of its customers and
 depending             on  type of  credit lines extended
  correspondent bank could be             more vulnerable to a stress experienced by a customer
 the supervisor may             wish to understand how this risk is being mitigated by  correspondent             bank
           
5
 intraday throughput and daily liquidity usage
 if a bank starts to defer its             payments and this coincides with a reduction in its liquidity usage 
as             measured by its largest positive net cumulative position
""
  supervisor may             wish to establish wher  bank has taken a strategic decision to delay             payments to reduce its usage of intraday liquidity
 this behavioural change             might also be of interest to  overseers given  potential knock-on             implications to or participants in  lvps

 its                                   management techniques and  derivation of                                    standardised interest rate shocks
        definition of interest rate risk in  banking book  98
1   interest rate risk in  banking book 
irrbb
 refers to  current or prospective         risk to a banks capital and to its earnings
 arising from  impact of adverse         movements in interest rates on its banking book
    98
2   excessive irrbb can pose a significant threat to a banks current capital base or         future earnings if not managed appropriately
 changes in interest rates can affect          underlying economic value of  banks assets
 liabilities and off-balance         sheet instruments
 because  present value of future cash flows 
and
 in many         cases
  amounts of cash flows mselves
 change when interest rates change
         changes in interest rates also affect a banks earnings by increasing or decreasing         its net interest income 
nii
 and  level of or interest rate-sensitive income         and operating expenses
    98
3   fundamentally
 re are two distinct methods for valuing banking book items
         namely
           
1
 amortised 
or historical
 cost
 where values are based on initial cost less             accumulated depreciation
" taking account of  expected life / maturity of              item"
 and           
2
 fair 
or market
 value
 where values are based on market prices 
where             available
 or on  net present value of expected cash flows
 discounted at              prevailing rate 
where no market price is available
""
    98
4   for items held at amortised cost
 market interest rate changes do not significantly         impact profit recognition or accounting values for existing instruments         
significant changes in values would be from impairment  needs to be         recognised as a permanent diminution in value
""
" income/cost on items held at         amortised cost refore emerges over time in line with maturity-adjusted cash         flows"
     however
  accounting value may not be  same as  balance                      needs to be managed for irrbb purposes
 because of  impact                     of effective interest rate calculations and  treatment of loan loss                     provisions
        98
5   accounting values of fair valued instruments can vary significantly from period to         period
 due to changes to external factors 
eg interest rate changes can impact               both  expected future cash flows and  discount rate used for calculation         purposes
""
 income and cost are recognised eir through profit and loss 
p&l
         or through equity
 on  basis of changes to embedded value
    98
6   since most irrbb economic value measures aim to estimate  change in         economic value under shocks and stresses
"  presence or absence of higher         /lower accounting values for amortised cost instruments is effectively ignored"
 as         is  emergence of profit over time
 it is refore important to note  a loss         in economic value does not automatically equate with accounting losses for this         element of  banking book
 conversely
" for assets held at fair value/mark-to"
        market
 changes in interest rates directly affect current accounting values
 and         thus have an immediate impact on both p&l and available capital
    98
7   every interest rate earned by a bank on its assets
 or paid on its liabilities
 is a         composite of a number of price components  some more easily identified than         ors
 theoretically
 all rates contain five elements
           
1
 the risk-free rate
 this is  fundamental building block for an interest rate
             representing  oretical rate of interest an investor would expect from a             risk-free investment for a given maturity
           
2
 a market duration spread
"  prices/valuations of instruments with long             durations are more vulnerable to market interest rate changes than those             with short durations"
 to reflect  uncertainty of both cash flows and              prevailing interest rate environment
 and consequent price volatility
              market requires a premium or spread over  risk-free rate to cover             duration risk
           
3
 a market liquidity spread
 even if  underlying instrument were risk-free
              interest rate may contain a premium to represent  market appetite for             investments and  presence of willing buyers and sellers
           
4
 a general market credit spread
 this is distinct from idiosyncratic credit             spread
 and represents  credit risk premium required by market             participants for a given credit quality 
eg  additional yield  a debt             instrument issued by an aa-rated entity must produce over a risk-free             alternative
""
             
5
 idiosyncratic credit spread
 this reflects  specific credit risk associated with              credit quality of  individual borrower 
"which will also reflect                   assessments of risks arising from  sector and geographical/currency             location of  borrower"
 and  specifics of  credit instrument 
eg             wher a bond or a derivative
""
    98
8   in ory se rate components apply across all types of credit exposure
 but in         practice y are more readily identifiable in traded instruments 
eg bonds
 than         in pure loans
 the latter tend to carry rates based on two components
           
1
 the funding rate
 or a reference rate plus a funding margin
  funding rate             is  blended internal cost of funding  loan
 reflected in  internal             funds transfer price 
for larger and more sophisticated banks
""
  reference             rate is an externally set benchmark rate
 such as  london interbank             offered rate 
libor
 or  federal funds rate
 to which a bank may need to             add 
or from which it may need to subtract
 a funding margin to reflect its             own all-in funding rate
 both  funding rate and  reference rate             incorporate liquidity and duration spread
 and potentially some elements of             market credit spread
 however
  relationship between  funding rate             and market reference rate may not be stable over time  this divergence is             an example of basis risk
           
2
 the credit margin 
or commercial margin
 applied
 this can be a specific add
            on 
eg libor 
 3%
 where  3% may include an element of funding             margin
 or built into an administered rate 
a rate set by and under              absolute control of  bank
""
    98
9   in practice
 decomposing interest rates into ir component parts is technically         demanding and  boundaries between  oretical components cannot         easily be calculated 
eg changes to market credit perceptions can also change         market liquidity spreads
""
 as a result
 some of  components may be         aggregated for interest rate risk management purposes
    98
10 changes to  risk-free rate
 market duration spread
 reference rate and funding        margin all fall within  definition of irrbb
 changes to  market liquidity        spreads and market credit spreads are combined within  definition of credit        spread risk in  banking book 
csrbb
""
 the diagram below gives a visual        representation of how  various elements fit toger
      98
11 the main driver of irrbb is a change in market interest rates
 both current and        expected
 as expressed by changes to  shape
 slope and level of a range of        different yield curves  incorporate some or all of  components of interest        rates
    98
12 when  level or shape of a yield curve for a given interest rate basis changes
         relationship between interest rates of different maturities of  same index        or market
 and relative to or yield curves for different instruments
 is affected
        this may result in changes to a banks income or underlying economic value
    98
13 csrbb is driven by changes in market perception about  credit quality of        groups of different credit-risky instruments
 eir because of changes to        expected default levels or because of changes to market liquidity
 changes to        underlying credit quality perceptions can amplify  risks already arising from        yield curve risk
" csrbb is refore defined as any kind of asset/liability spread        risk of credit-risky instruments which is not explained by irrbb"
" nor by         expected credit/jump-to-default risk"
      98
14 this chapter and srp31 focus mainly on irrbb
 csrbb is a related risk  needs        to be monitored and assessed
    98
15 irrbb derives from three fundamental aspects relating to  level and structural        characteristics of interest rates
 and  effects on se of changes to yield        curves
 these aspects of interest rate risk can occur simultaneously
 and refore        need to be managed holistically
           
1
 gap risk arises from  term structure of banking book instruments
 and             describes  risk arising from  timing of instrument rate changes
 since             rate resets on different instruments occur at different tenors
  risk to              bank arises when  rate of interest paid on liabilities increases before              rate of interest received on assets
 or reduces on assets before liabilities
             unless hedged in terms of tenor and amount
  bank may be exposed to a             period of reduced or negative interest margins
 or may experience changes             in  relative economic values of assets and liabilities
 the extent of gap risk             depends also on wher changes to  term structure of interest rates             occur consistently across  yield curve 
parallel risk
 or differentially by             period 
non-parallel risk
""
           
2
 basis risk describes  impact of relative changes in interest rates for             financial instruments  have similar tenors but are priced using different             interest rate indices 
bases
 
eg an asset priced off libor funded by a liability             priced off us treasuries
""
 it arises from  imperfect correlation in              adjustment of  rates earned and paid on different instruments with             orwise similar rate change characteristics
 for  purposes of this             chapter
 irrbb is defined as excluding changes in idiosyncratic credit             margins

3
 option risk arises from option derivative positions or from  optional             elements embedded in many bank assets
 liabilities and off-balance sheet             items
 where  bank or its customers can alter  level and timing of ir             cash flows
 for irrbb purposes
 option risk can be broken down into two             distinct but related sub-types
               
a
 automatic option risk arising from standalone instruments
 such as                 exchange-traded and over--counter option contracts
 or explicitly                 embedded within  contractual terms of an orwise standard                 financial instrument 
eg a capped rate loan
 and where  holder will                 almost certainly exercise  option if it is in ir financial interest to do                 so
 and               
b
 behavioural option risk arising from flexibility embedded implicitly or                 within  terms of financial contracts
 such  changes in interest                 rates may effect a change in  behaviour of  client 
eg rights of a                    borrower to prepay a loan
 with or without penalty
 or  right of a                  depositor to withdraw ir balance in search of higher yield
""
     this may sometimes be referred to as yield curve risk
      98
16 in addition to  pure economic risks  can arise from changes to  level        and structure of interest rates
 risks can arise from
           
1
 currency mismatches
 ie where  interest rate risks are in addition to             normal exchange rate risks 
this falls within a wider definition of basis risk
""
 or           
2
 accounting treatment of risk positions
 ie where interest rate hedging activity             may achieve  desired economic effect
 but fail to achieve hedge             accounting treatment
      measurement of irrbb  98
17 there are two complementary methods of measuring  potential impact of        irrbb
           
1
 changes in expected earnings 
earnings-based measures
""
 and           
2
 changes in economic value 
ev
 or eve when measuring  change in value             relative to equity
""
        98
18 the two methods are complementary in 
          
1
 both measures reflect  impact of changing cash flows arising from            changing interest rates
          
2
  change in expected earnings is reflected in  change in economic            value
 and          
3
 y are affected by common assumptions
    98
19 the key differences between  measures include
          
1
 outcome measure
 ev measures compute a change in  net present value            of  balance sheet under an interest rate stress
 in undertaking such a            calculation
 a decision has to be made about wher  outcome should            be computed as a change in  oretical economic value of equity 
eve
             in which case
 equity is eir excluded from  ev calculation or included            with a very short 
overnight
 duration
 or wher  outcome should            measure  change in economic value or than for assets representing            equity  in which case
 equity is eir included with  same duration as             assets which it is deemed to be financing
 or else both equity and its            portfolio of financed assets are excluded 
this is earnings-adjusted ev
""
 eve            and earnings-adjusted ev are refore specific forms of an ev measure
 all            ev measures can be expressed relative to equity
 but eve includes             change to equity value  would result from revaluing under stress its own            financed portfolio of assets
 earnings-based measures focus on changes to            future profitability
 to  extent  future earnings eventually affect levels            of future equity
  two measures are aligned
 but  value changes            estimated include adjustments to net income  occur beyond  horizon            for earnings measures
          
2
 time horizon
 ev measures reflect changes in value relative to equity over             remaining life of  balance sheet
 ie until all positions have run off
            earnings-based measures cover only  short to medium term
 and            refore do not capture in full those risks  will continue to impact profit            and loss accounts beyond  period of estimation
          
3
 future transactions
 ev measures usually just focus on changes to cash flows            of instruments already on  balance sheet
 earnings-based measures can            be based on balance sheet run-off
 or a static balance sheet
" but more            sophisticated or dynamic models tend to consider  impact of new            business/production  is expected to be written in  future"
 as well as             run-off of existing business
        98
20 for earnings-based measures
  focus for analysis is  impact of changes in        interest rates on future accrued or reported earnings
    98
21 the component of earnings  has traditionally received  most attention is        nii
 ie  difference between total interest income and total interest expense
        taking account of hedging activity 
eg via derivatives
""
 this focus reflects both         importance of nii in banks overall earnings and its direct link to changes in        interest rates
        note
 however
 
 as some banks have expanded increasingly into                     activities  generate fee-based and or non-interest income
" a                     broader focus on operating earnings/overall net income"
 incorporating                     both interest and non-interest income and expenses
 has become more                     common
      98
22 an earnings-based measure offers  possibility of measuring risk under a range        of different time horizons
" the normal focus is on  short/medium-term        horizon "
typically one to three years
 no more than five years
""
 to limit         cumulative impact of underlying assumptions and  complexity of         calculations
 as a consequence
 an earnings-based measure is better suited to        measuring  short
and medium-term vulnerabilities of  bank to irrbb
        assuming  it is able to continue in business 
a going-concern viewpoint

23 an earnings-based measure is refore commonly used to assess  ability of a        bank to generate stable earnings over a medium-term horizon
 which will allow it        to pay a stable level of dividend and reduce  beta on its equity price and        refore reduce its cost of capital
 hence
 it is a measure in line with internal        management and asset and liability management objectives
    98
24 in order to be able to calculate changes in expected earnings under different        interest rate shocks and stress scenarios
 an institution will need to be able to        project future earnings under both  expected economic scenario  informs        its corporate plan
 and  interest rate shock and stress scenarios so          differences can be measured
" such projections involve a range of furr        assumptions about client/market behaviour"
 and  banks own management        response to  evolving economic climate
 including
           
1
"  volume and type of new/replacement assets and liabilities expected to             be originated over  evaluation period"
           
2
"  volume and type of asset and liability redemptions/reductions over              period"
             
3
  interest rate basis and margin associated with  new assets and             liabilities
" and with those redeemed/withdrawn"
 and           
4
"  impact of any fees collected/paid for exercise of options"
    98
25 in practical terms
 this may result in modelling of earnings under three different        states
           
1
 run-off balance sheet
 existing assets and liabilities not replaced as y             mature
 except to  extent necessary to fund  remaining balance sheet
           
2
 constant balance sheet
 total balance sheet size and shape maintained by             assuming like-for-like replacement of assets and liabilities as y run off
 and           
3
 dynamic balance sheet
 incorporating future business expectations
 adjusted             for  relevant scenario in a consistent manner
 ie this is  most             meaningful approach
    98
26 under an economic value approach
  measure of irrbb is  oretical        change in  net embedded market value of  whole banking book
    98
27 the ev of a tradable instrument is its present value 
pv
""
 in  absence of        embedded options
  pv of  instrument is determined from its contractual        cash flows
 which are discounted to reflect current market rates
 as a first        implication
 instruments with short-term or variable rate cash flows have a        present value  more nearly equals ir face value 
ie ir carrying value
""
 as        a second implication
 a change in market rates would not change  ev of such        instruments
 third
  pv of an interest rate-sensitive instrument with uncertain        contractual cash flows can only be valued on  basis of assumptions about        behaviour and timing
 which will tend to vary dependent upon external factors
          98
28 applying  concept of ev to  whole balance sheet of a bank is more        challenging
  banking book contains assets and liabilities  are accounted        for at held-to-maturity valuation
 and for which re may not be observable        market prices 
eg loans and receivables are not as readily marketable and ir        market value cannot be determined directly
""
 moreover
 re may be embedded        under
and overvaluations in  book on a mark-to-market basis
 representing        income or costs  will emerge in future reported earnings
 in addition
 margins        on loans may be very heterogeneous
 thus making determination of an        appropriate discount rate problematic
 and  cash flows  are being valued        are subject to variation depending upon customer behaviour in response to rate        changes 
and customers may not behave as might rationally be expected
""
 finally
        re may be structural positions 
eg assets held to stabilise return on non
"       maturity deposits and/or equity"
 which will produce a significant change in value        under ev measurement
 but where  risk measured is a direct corollary of risk        reduction from an earnings volatility perspective
      for example
 a bank with $100 of capital could manage its earnings                     volatility by investing all capital in a long-dated fixed rate government                     security  which would lock in a consistent income but produce                     economic value risk if market rates changed and  mark-to-market                     value of  security declined
 if its aim was to achieve economic value                     stability
 it could invest its capital in  overnight market
 but its                     earnings would n fluctuate with market interest rates
 it is not                     possible for it to eliminate both ev and earnings risks simultaneously
                     so a trade-off is needed
      98
29 to avoid  complexity of measuring total ev
 banks typically refore focus on        measuring  level of change to  net present value of  relevant balance        sheet items
 based on existing or adjusted cash flows  are revalued in line        with  interest rate shock and stress scenarios
 the change in  valuation is a        measure of  level of irrbb
 and can be compared with  current value of        equity to determine  change to  eve
      key considerations and assumptions  98
30 both measures of irrbb are significantly impacted by assumptions made for         purposes of risk quantification
                 
1
  range of shocks to  possible changes in  level
 slope and shape of             interest rate yield curves  are required to produce an irrbb effect on ev             or earnings
 and  economic stress scenarios  would be consistent with             se shocks
           
2
 expectations for  exercise of options 
explicit and implicit
 by both              bank itself and its customers under  given scenarios
           
3
 treatment in risk quantifications of balances and interest flows arising from             non-maturity deposits 
nmds
""
           
4
  banks own determination of  implied investment term of  banks             own equity capital liability
 and           
5
  implications for irrbb of adopted accounting practices
    98
31 in order to produce a quantitative estimate of irrbb
 it is necessary to assume a        shock to current interest rate levels
 which would allow  change in ev or        earnings
 and ultimately  effect on equity
 to be computed
 the size and shape        of  shock will determine  measured outcome
 and a range of shocks may        be needed to identify all  potential facets of irrbb 
eg basis risks would not        be captured by shocks  assume only parallel shifts of similar quantum in all        yield curves
""
 designing interest rate change scenarios  are relevant to         business and sufficiently stressful is a key element of irrbb management    98
32 behaviour of option positions is one of  key set of assumptions  drive risk        quantification measures
 the approach taken by banks generally differs between        automatic options
 where  customer and bank can assume   exercise of        options will be based on rational expectations
 and behavioural options
 where        behaviour will not always be rational and behavioural assumptions need to be        used instead
    98
33 automatic option positions can refore be valued on  basis  exercise will        always 
and only
 occur when re is financial benefit 
with valuation based on        standard financial modelling techniques and  results are fed into ev        estimates
""
 the rational expectation   options will be exercised can also be        readily fed into forward projections of interest margin under earnings-based        measures
      98
34 behavioural option positions require more complex analysis of expected        outcomes
 since customers may exercise some options even when it is not in ir        financial interest to do so
 or may not exercise options even when it would be to           ir benefit
 the most complex area of behavioural analysis is for prepayment         options on loans
  right to redeem early may be included voluntarily in a loan         contract
 or imposed on  lender by operation of national law
 re may or         may not be early redemption penalties payable
 but again  size of se         penalties may not reflect  actual economic costs and benefits involved 
eg if         limited by law or by operation of customer redress policy
""
 and customers may         choose to redeem for or reasons than  availability of a new loan at lower         cost 
eg due housing prices
 borrowers demographics
 changing family         composition
 tax changes
""
    98
35 however
 not all borrowers will act irrationally
 and exercise of early redemption        options will tend to have a detrimental effect on eir an ev or an earnings
       based measurement
 ie in a classic case of convexity risk
 borrowers will tend to        repay fixed rate borrowings when rates fall 
so  y can borrow again at a        lower rate
 and retain fixed rate positions when market rates rise 
so  banks        are unable to lend at  higher rates
""
 in order to manage this redemption or        extension risk
 banks model ir books to establish how much should be        hedged
 and for what period
 in order to match ir best expectations of cash        flows
 such behavioural modelling is clearly prone to error
 and needs frequent        updating so  hedge positions can be adjusted
 therefore
 when using        economic value and earnings-based measures
 banks need to review and adjust        ir calculations to account for any expected behaviours
    98
36 the use of economic value and earnings-based measures involves estimating        cash flows
 but  content and treatment is different
 for ev measures
 all        existing balance sheet items 
both principal and interest flows
 are discounted at        a relevant rate
 whereas nii measures include all cash flows
 including all margins        and principal flows from expected future business
 and are normally not        discounted
    98
37 nmds are liabilities of  banks in which  depositor is free to withdraw at any        time since y have no contractually agreed maturity date
 notwithstanding
        nmd balances have historically proved to be relatively stable in practice
 even        when market rates change
 and balances lost can usually be replaced with new        deposits at  same rate  so
 overall
 nmds behave differently to or more        rate-sensitive funding
 any interest paid on nmds is usually at rates significantly        below those paid for wholesale or larger-denomination deposits
 so nmd        balances have historically represented an important source of stable and cost
       effective funding
           a subset of nmds is non-interest bearing current accounts
 where                     balances may fluctuate but are generally not interest bearing
 current                     account customers hold balances mainly for transactional purposes
                     and are more sensitive to service levels
           however
 nmd sensitivity may have increased as a result of                      sustained period of accommodative monetary policy in some of                      worlds largest economies
      98
38 in considering irrbb
  focus for some banks is refore primarily on        managing  risk of earnings volatility arising from nmds
 in order to achieve        this
 banks first identify core deposits
 ie  element of nmds  can be        considered to be particularly stable under different interest rate scenarios so         a behavioural maturity can be ascribed specifically to m and matching assets        allocated to stabilise earnings
 in assessing core balances
 banks discount those        elements of transactional accounts which are subject to regular fluctuation        
withdrawal followed by re-deposit
 and overall seasonality of  nmd book
    98
39 the matching book of assets may n be managed dynamically to adjust for        changes in levels of core deposits
 and to maintain a constant maturity in line        with expected behaviour and  banks risk appetite
 although  behavioural        maturity may be determined to be very long
  matching asset position carries        risk to a banks ev since
 being fixed rate and of some duration
  net present        value of this portfolio will vary with general interest rates
 the maturity profile        chosen will refore be a compromise between protection of earnings for an        extended period and increased risk to ev  could materialise on a shock event        
eg a deposit run on nmds
 failure of  bank
""
 internal risk measures can be        used to evaluate  extent and impact of  compromise made
      one common technique for achieving a constant maturity profile is a                     replicating portfolio of matching assets  produces a moving                     average fixed return in line with  risk appetite 
eg a portfolio where                     one sixtieth of  total is reinvested each month for five years fixed                     will deliver a weighted average maturity of 2
5 years and a moving                     average of  five-year rate
""
            98
40 in  same way as with nmds
 a banks own equity capital liability represents an        important source of structural risk and endowment return  in accounting terms
        equity is  net value of assets less liabilities
 so it represents assets for which        re are no funding liabilities
 equity usually has a cost in  form of a dividend         
although not in  case of mutual or cooperative organisations
""
 and banks         refore seek to stabilise  earnings  can be made on assets funded by         equity
    98
41 the technique involves defining net equity capital  is eligible for behavioural        treatment  some assets are non-interest bearing 
eg land and buildings
 and        may be considered to be financed by equity
 so  value of equity available for        behavioural treatment may be reduced accordingly
 since equity capital has no        contractual price reset date
 banks determine ir own strategies for managing         earnings volatility  arises from it using techniques similar to those for        nmds
 given  equity may be written down as a result of losses
 regulators will        normally focus on  eve risk associated with any earnings profile ascribed to        equity  may materialise as losses under stress events
          banks may also determine  a portion of equity should remain                      invested short-term as a buffer against losses  may be incurred                      under a more general business stress
        quantifying irrbb
 economic value  98
42 change in economic value can be measured using a variety of techniques
         most common of which are
           
1
 pv01
 present value of a single basis point change in interest rates based on             gap analysis
           
2
 eve
 economic value of equity
 and           
3
 evar
 economic value at risk
    98
43 the techniques differ in ir complexity and ability to capture different types of        interest rate sensitivity 
gap risk 
parallel and non-parallel
""
 yield curve risk
 basis        risk and option risk
""
 multiple measures of ev sensitivity refore produce a        better overall understanding of risks embedded in  banking book
          98
44 gap analysis can be used to derive  duration profile of  banking book or
        equivalently
  profile of  present value of a single basis point change in        interest rates 
pv01
""
 gap analysis allocates all relevant interest rate-sensitive         assets and liabilities to a certain number of predefined time buckets according to         ir next contractual reset date
 the analysis also allocates equity
 nmds
"         prepaying loans or or instruments with future cash flows subject to customer         behaviours according to general/behavioural assumptions regarding ir         maturity or reset date"
 it n measures  arithmetic difference 
 gap
         between  amounts of assets and liabilities in each time bucket
 in absolute         terms
 each time bucket gap can be multiplied by an assumed change in interest         rates to yield an approximation of  change in nii  would result from an         increase in interest rates
 this method gives a visual impression of  risk         exposure dispersion relative to  repricing profile
 reflecting exposures to         parallel as well as non-parallel gap risk
 it does not
 however
 quantify this risk
         the measure assumes  all positions within a particular time bucket mature         and reprice simultaneously
 ignoring potential basis risks within  gaps
           a variant of  technique
 modified duration
 could be applied
 which                     shows  relative change in  market value of a financial instrument                     corresponding to marginal parallel shift of  yield curve 
eg by 1                     percentage point
""
 the weakness of this technique is  it measures                     only marginal shifts of  yield curve and works only for parallel shifts
      98
45 ev measures mainly focus on valuing  cash flows arising from existing assets        and liabilities under different future interest scenarios
 ignoring future business        flows
 the change in ev 
ie  change in  npv of future cash flows as a result        of a change in rates
 can be calculated across all types of assets and liabilities
        when a change in  ev of  whole banking book is calculated
  outcome is        highly influenced by  treatment of  banks own equity capital liability in         calculation
 there are two possible approaches
           
1
 since accounting equity is  net residual figure  arises from subtracting             total liabilities from total assets 
including off-balance sheet items
""
             measuring  change in  net present value of those assets and liabilities             under a stressed interest rate scenario shows  actual level of risk to              economic value of equity
 in this calculation
 refore
 no rate or term is             applied to equity itself
 which is refore excluded
 and  npv outcome is             compared with  starting value of equity in order to measure              proportionate size of  change
 this is  eve measure
                 
2
 given  equity finances surplus assets  earn an endowment return for              bank
  change in value of any asset portfolio  has been created to             reduce  volatility of earnings on equity is not a relevant ev risk for              bank 
ie it has taken  ev risk specifically to hedge earnings risk
""
 in this             calculation
 refore
" equity is included in  calculation and treated as             having  same interest rate/term characteristics as  portfolio of assets              hedges  earnings on it"
 the npv outcome is still compared with              starting value of equity
 but measures only risks arising from non-structural             positions
 this measure is earnings-adjusted ev    98
46 eve measures  oretical change in  net present value of  balance        sheet excluding equity
 the measure refore depicts  change in equity value        resulting from an interest rate shock
 under this method
  value of equity        under alternative stress scenarios is compared with  value under a base        scenario
 all cash flows from on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet interest rate
       sensitive items in  banking book may be included in  computation
 the        market value of equity is computed as  present value of asset cash flows
 less         present value of liability cash flows
 without including assumptions on         interest rate sensitivity of equity
 for internal measurement purposes
 a bank may        complement its computation of eve with a separate earnings-adjusted ev model         uses assumptions about  investment term of equity
 whereby its interest        rate sensitivity is taken into account
    98
47 the accuracy of  measure is extremely dependent upon  precision of         cash flows calculated
 and on  discount rates used in  calculation
 when         expected cash flows are calculated
 any likelihood   size and  timing of        future cash flows may differ between scenarios depending upon customer        behaviour in reaction to  rate environment needs to be considered
    98
48 depending on its specific design
" an ev/eve measure can capture all types of        interest rate sensitivity"
 gap risk 
parallel and non-parallel
 will be captured        depending on  specific yield curve risk used in  alternative scenario
 in        computing ev
 a full revaluation of automatic options would be normal under        each of  alternative scenarios
 so automatic option risk measurement is an        integral part of a standard ev measure
 behavioural optionality can also be        captured if stressed behavioural assumptions are used in alternative scenarios
        banks can n compute  ev effect of a change in customer behaviour eir        separately or in conjunction with a yield curve shift
    98
49 ev is a technique  can also be used to estimate basis risk in  banking book
        eir in isolation
 or when combined with a general yield curve shift or with a        change in assumed parameters
 basis risk can be measured by designing a        scenario under which re is a divergence in  different base rates to which a        bank is specifically sensitive
      98
50 economic value at risk 
evar
 measures  expected maximum reduction of        market value  can be incurred under normal market circumstances over a        given time horizon or holding period and subject to a given confidence level
 for        calculation of evar in  banking book
  changes in  market value of         banking book and thus of  equity are computed for a set of alternative yield        curve scenarios
 when  evar approach is applied to  banking book
         time horizon is normally consistent with  economic model of  banking        book
 the standard var approach comprises three different techniques
 historical        simulation
 variance-covariance approach and monte carlo simulation
    under this approach
 interest rates of different tenors are derived from                     historical observations of changes and a variance-covariance matrix is                     constructed to account for  correlations between  rate shocks                     across tenors
      98
51 evar models are suited to capture all types of interest rate sensitivity such as eve
        however
 evar measurement techniques have ir limitations
 evar is designed        for normal market circumstances and does not adequately assess tail risk
 both        historical value-at-risk 
var
 and variance-covariance var are backward-looking        methods which are prone to missing  tail events  carry significant risks
        the monte carlo simulation method is very demanding in terms of technology        and computational power
      quantifying irrbb
 earnings-based measures  98
52 earnings-based measures look at  expected increase or reduction in nii over a        shorter time horizon 
typically one to three years
 up to a maximum five years
        resulting from interest rate movements  are composed of eir a gradual or        a one-time large interest rate shock
 the change in nii is  difference in         expected nii between a base scenario and an alternative
 more stressful scenario
        the base case scenario reflects  banks current corporate plan in projecting         volume
 pricing and repricing dates of future business transactions
 interest rates        used for resetting transactions in  base scenario can be derived from market        expected rates or from spot rates
 the rate for each instrument will also contain        appropriate projected spreads and margins
        98
53 in assessing  possible extent of change in nii
 banks can use models to predict         path of rates and  run-off of existing assets and liabilities
 earnings        measures can be differentiated according to  complexity of ir forward        calculations of income
 from simple run-off models which assume  existing           assets and liabilities mature without replacement
 to constant balance sheet         models which assume  assets and liabilities are replaced like for like
 to          most complex dynamic models which reflect  changes in  volumes and         types of business  will be undertaken 
or not undertaken
 in differing interest         rate environments
 with  expected level of prices in those circumstances
    98
54 an earnings-based measure analyses  interest rate risk profile of  banking        book in a detailed way tailored to  banks specific circumstances
 as it can        account for new business
 it reflects a full going-concern perspective
 depending        on  design of  alternative scenarios
 this method is able to capture all        different types of interest rate risk sensitivity
 banks are able to incorporate fully         cash flow changes  occur under alternative scenarios due to automatic        options
    98
55 however
  results of  modelling are highly sensitive to assumptions about        customer behaviour as well as to  anticipated management responses to        different rate scenarios
 earnings-based measures cover a relatively short time        horizon
 so changes in earnings falling beyond  observation period are        ignored 
"including those arising from any behavioural treatment of nmds and/or        equity  involves long-term structural positions to reduce earnings volatility"
""
        last but not least
 earnings-based measures do not necessarily identify  risks        to capital  can arise from revaluation of available-for-sale portfolios
      derivation of  interest rate shocks  98
56 srp31 describes six prescribed interest rate shock scenarios  banks should        apply to parallel and non-parallel gap risks for eve and two prescribed interest        rate shock scenarios for nii

          supervisory transparency and accountability  99
1   the supervision of banks is not an exact science
 and refore
 discretionary         elements within  supervisory review process are inevitable
 supervisors must         take care to carry out ir obligations in a transparent and accountable manner
         supervisors should make publicly available  criteria to be used in  review of         banks internal capital assessments
 if a supervisor chooses to set target or trigger         ratios or to set categories of capital in excess of  regulatory minimum
 factors          may be considered in doing so should be publicly available
 where          capital requirements are set above  minimum for an individual bank
          supervisor should explain to  bank  risk characteristics specific to  bank         which resulted in  requirement and any remedial action necessary
      enhanced cross-border communication and cooperation  99
2   effective supervision of large banking organisations necessarily entails a close         and continuous dialogue between industry participants and supervisors
 in         addition
  framework will require enhanced cooperation between supervisors
         on a practical basis
 especially for  cross-border supervision of complex         international banking groups
    99
3   the framework will not change  legal responsibilities of national supervisors         for  regulation of ir domestic institutions or  arrangements for         consolidated supervision as set out in  existing basel committee standards
         the home country supervisor is responsible for  oversight of          implementation of  framework for a banking group on a consolidated basis
         host country supervisors are responsible for supervision of those entities         operating in ir countries
 in order to reduce  compliance burden and avoid         regulatory arbitrage
  methods and approval processes used by a bank at          group level may be accepted by  host country supervisor at  local level
         provided  y adequately meet  local supervisors requirements
         wherever possible
 supervisors should avoid performing redundant and         uncoordinated approval and validation work in order to reduce          implementation burden on banks
 and conserve supervisory resources
    99
4   in implementing  framework
 supervisors should communicate  respective         roles of home country and host country supervisors as clearly as possible to         banking groups with significant cross-border operations in multiple jurisdictions
         the home country supervisor would lead this coordination effort in cooperation         with  host country supervisors
 in communicating  respective supervisory         roles
 supervisors will take care to clarify  existing supervisory legal         responsibilities remain unchanged
            99
5   the committee supports a pragmatic approach of mutual recognition for         internationally active banks as a key basis for international supervisory co
        operation
 this approach implies recognising common capital adequacy         approaches when considering  entities of internationally active banks in host         jurisdictions
 as well as  desirability of minimising differences in  national         capital adequacy regulations between home and host jurisdictions so          subsidiary banks are not subjected to excessive burden
    99
6   before giving consent to  creation of a cross-border establishment
  host         country authority and  banks and banking groups home country authorities         should each review  allocation of supervisory responsibilities recommended in          concordat in order to determine wher its application to  proposed         establishment is appropriate
 if
 as a result of  establishments proposed         activities or  location and structure of  banks or  banking groups         management
 eir authority concludes   division of supervisory         responsibilities suggested in  concordat is not appropriate
 n  authority         consults with  or authority on how to promote effective supervisory         cooperation
 eir generally or in respect of specific activities
 a similar review         should be undertaken by all authorities if re is a significant change in  bank         s or banking groups activities or structure

 incorporates elements of both pillar 1 and pillar 2
 the indicator-based         measurement approach
  pre-specified requirements for banks within each         bucket and  fixed consequences of not meeting  requirement can be         considered close to pillar 1
 however
  use of supervisory judgment to finalise          allocation of individual banks to buckets can be considered close to pillar 2
         irrespective of wher  higher loss absorbency requirement is considered to         be a pillar 1 or a pillar 2 approach
 it is essentially a requirement in addition to         or capital buffers and  minimum capital requirement
 with a predetermined         set of consequences for banks  do not meet  requirement

10 in some jurisdictions
 pillar 2 may need to adapt to accommodate  existence        of  higher loss absorbency requirements for g-sibs or d-sibs
 specifically
 it        would make sense for authorities to ensure  a banks pillar 2 requirements do        not require capital to be held twice for issues related to  externalities        associated with distress or failure of g-sibs or d-sibs if y are captured by         higher loss absorbency requirement
 however
 pillar 2 will normally capture or        risks  are not directly related to se externalities of g-sibs and d-sibs

1   the provision of meaningful information about common key risk metrics to         market participants is a fundamental tenet of a sound banking system
 it reduces         information asymmetry and helps promote comparability of banks risk profiles         within and across jurisdictions
 pillar 3 of  basel framework aims to promote         market discipline through regulatory disclosure requirements
 these         requirements enable market participants to access key information relating to a         banks regulatory capital and risk exposures in order to increase transparency and         confidence about a banks exposure to risk and  overall adequacy of its         regulatory capital

12 the committee believes   disclosure requirements strike an appropriate        balance between  need for meaningful disclosure and  protection of        proprietary and confidential information
 in exceptional cases
 disclosure of        certain items required by pillar 3 may reveal  position of a bank or contravene        its legal obligations by making public information  is proprietary or        confidential in nature
 in such cases
 a bank does not need to disclose those        specific items

      guiding principles of banks pillar 3 disclosures  10
13 the committee has agreed upon five guiding principles for banks
pillar 3        disclosures
 pillar 3 complements  minimum risk-based capital requirements        and or quantitative requirements 
pillar 1
 and  supervisory review process        
pillar 2
 and aims to promote market discipline by providing meaningful        regulatory information to investors and or interested parties on a consistent        and comparable basis
 the guiding principles aim to provide a firm foundation        for achieving transparent
 high-quality pillar 3 risk disclosures  will enable        users to better understand and compare a bank  business and its risks
  principle 1
 disclosures should be clear  10
14 disclosures should be presented in a form  is understandable to key        stakeholders 
ie investors
 analysts
 financial customers and ors
 and        communicated through an accessible medium
 important messages should be        highlighted and easy to find
 complex issues should be explained in simple        language with important terms defined
 related risk information should be        presented toger
      principle 2
 disclosures should be comprehensive  10
15 disclosures should describe a bank  main activities and all significant risks
        supported by relevant underlying data and information
 significant changes in        risk exposures between reporting periods should be described
 toger with         appropriate response by management
    10
16 disclosures should provide sufficient information in both qualitative and        quantitative terms on a bank  processes and procedures for identifying
        measuring and managing those risks
 the level of detail of such disclosure should        be proportionate to a bank  complexity
    10
17 approaches to disclosure should be sufficiently flexible to reflect how senior        management and  board of directors internally assess and manage risks and        strategy
" helping users to better understand a bank  risk tolerance/appetite"
      principle 3
 disclosures should be meaningful to users  10
18 disclosures should highlight a bank  most significant current and emerging risks        and how those risks are managed
 including information  is likely to receive        market attention
 where meaningful
 linkages must be provided to line items on         balance sheet or  income statement
 disclosures  do not add value to        users

      presentation of  disclosure requirements  templates and tables  10
21 the disclosure requirements are presented eir in  form of templates or        tables
 templates must be completed with quantitative data in accordance with         definitions provided
 tables generally relate to qualitative requirements
 but        quantitative information is also required in some instances
 banks may choose         format y prefer when presenting  information requested in tables
    10
22 in line with principle 3 in dis10

  information provided in  templates and        tables should be meaningful to users
 the disclosure requirements in this        document  necessitate an assessment from banks are specifically identified
        when preparing se individual tables and templates
 banks will need to        consider carefully how widely  disclosure requirement should apply
 if a bank        considers   information requested in a template or table would not be        meaningful to users
 for example because  exposures and risk-weighted asset        
rwa
 amounts are deemed immaterial
 it may choose not to disclose part or all        of  information requested
 in such circumstances
 however
  bank will be        required to explain in a narrative commentary why it considers such information        not to be meaningful to users
 it should describe  portfolios excluded from         disclosure requirement and  aggregate total rwa those portfolios represent
    10
23 for templates
  format is designated as eir fixed or flexible

 where  format of a template is described as fixed
 banks must complete              fields in accordance with  instructions given
" if a row/column is not             considered to be relevant to a bank  activities or  required information             would not be meaningful to users "

""
"  bank may delete  specific row/column from              template"
 but  numbering of  subsequent rows and columns must not             be altered
 banks may add extra rows and extra columns to fixed format             templates if y wish to provide additional detail to a disclosure             requirement by adding sub-rows or columns
 but  numbering of             prescribed rows and columns in  template must not be altered

 where  format of a template is described as flexible
 banks may present              required information eir in  format provided in this document or in             one  better suits  bank
 the format for  presentation of qualitative               information in tables is not prescribed
 notwithstanding
 banks should             comply with  restrictions in presentation
 should such restrictions be             prescribed in  template 
eg template ccr5 in dis42

 in addition
 when a             customised presentation of  information is used
  bank must provide             information comparable with  required in  disclosure requirement

ie entities  are part of a             material subgroup
 which have issued internal tlac to one or more             resolution entities
 and also for resolution entities
 these templates provide             information on  amount and residual maturity of tlac and on              instruments issued by resolution entities and material subgroup entities              rank pari passu with

4   templates tlac1
 tlac2 and tlac3 become effective from  tlac         conformance date

5   through  following three-step approach
 all banks are required to show          link between  balance sheet in ir published financial statements and          numbers disclosed in template cc1
             
1
 step 1
 disclose  reported balance sheet under  regulatory scope of           consolidation in template cc2
 if  scopes of regulatory consolidation and           accounting consolidation are identical for a particular banking group
 banks           should state in template cc2  re is no difference and move on to           step 2
 where  accounting and regulatory scopes of consolidation differ
           banks are required to disclose  list of those legal entities  are included           within  accounting scope of consolidation
 but excluded from            regulatory scope of consolidation or
 alternatively
 any legal entities included           in  regulatory consolidation  are not included in  accounting scope           of consolidation
 this will enable users of pillar 3 data to consider any risks           posed by unconsolidated subsidiaries
 if some entities are included in both            regulatory and accounting scopes of consolidation
 but  method of           consolidation differs between se two scopes
 banks are required to list            relevant legal entities separately and explain  differences in            consolidation methods
 for each legal entity  is required to be disclosed           in this requirement
 a bank must also disclose  total assets and equity on            entitys balance sheet and a description of  entitys principal activities
         
2
 step 2
 expand  lines of  balance sheet under  regulatory scope of           consolidation in template cc2 to display all of  components  are           used in template cc1
 it should be noted  banks will only need to           expand elements of  balance sheet to  extent necessary to determine            components  are used in template cc1 
eg if all of  paid-in           capital of  bank meets  requirements to be included in common           equity tier 1

  bank would not need to expand this line

 the insertion of any  rows        must leave  numbering of  remaining rows unchanged
 eg rows detailing national        specific regulatory adjustments to cet1 could be labelled row 26a

 to ensure           subsequent row numbers are not affected
     in cases where  national implementation of basel iii applies a more conservative definition  of        an element listed in  template
 national authorities may choose between two  approaches
         
approach 1
 in  national version of  template
 maintain  same definitions of all  rows            as set out in  template
 and require banks to report  impact of  more            conservative national definition in  designated rows for national specific adjustments            
ie rows 26
 41 and 56
""
         
approach 2
 in  national version of  template
 use  definitions of elements as           implemented in  jurisdiction
 clearly labelling m as being different from  basel           iii minimum definition
 and require banks to separately disclose  impact of each of           se different definitions in  notes to  template
    the aim of both approaches is to provide all  information necessary to enable users of pillar  3  data to calculate  capital of banks on a common basis
  template cc2 
reconciliation of regulatory capital to balance sheet          purpose

 clearly label m as being different from  tlac          definition
 and require g-sibs to separately disclose  impact of each of se different          definitions in  notes to  template

 under a regulatory scope of consolidation
  accounting                    carrying amount and  regulatory exposure value would vary due to                     incidence of off-balance sheet elements
 provisions

 under market risk
  regulatory                    exposure value will also differ from  accounting carrying amount
                    differences could be due to off-balance sheet items
 netting rules and                    different measurement rules of market risk positions via prudent                    valuation

           faq       faq1       how should  disclosure be made in template cr3
 in an example                  where a loan has multiple types of credit risk mitigation and is over
                 collateralised 
eg a loan of 100 with land collateral of 120 as well as                  guarantees of 50
?                    when an exposure benefits from multiple types of credit risk mitigation                  mechanisms
  exposure value should be allocated to each                  mechanism by order of priority based on  credit risk mitigation                  mechanism which banks would apply in  event of loss
 disclosure                  should be limited to  value of  exposure 
ie  amount of over
                 collateralisation does not need to be disclosed in  table
""
 if  bank                  wishes to disclose information regarding  over-collateralisation

         faq2       what are  values to be ascribed to collateral
 guarantees and credit                  derivatives in template cr3?                    banks should disclose  amount of credit risk mitigation calculated                  according to  regulatory framework
 including both  costs to sell                  and of haircut
         faq3       where should exposures to central counterparties 
ccps
 be included?                    exposures for trades
 initial margins and default fund contributions are                  included in template ccr8
 exposures stemming from loans to ccps                  excluding initial margins and default fund contributions should be                  included within  credit risk framework considering  ccp as an                       asset class item
 these loans should be included in  exposure class                 where  national implementation of  basel framework allows                 exposures to ccps to be included
         faq4      in template cr7
 what is  required disclosure if an exposure is only                 partially hedged by a credit derivative? for instance
 consider a loan                 with nominal exposure of $100
 risk weight of 150% and refore                 rwa of $150
 the bank buys a credit default swap with a $30 nominal                 amount

1   the core principles for effective banking supervision 
core principles
 are  de         facto minimum standard for sound prudential regulation and supervision of         banks and banking systems
 originally issued by  basel committee on banking         supervision 
 committee
 in 1997
 y are used by countries as a benchmark         for assessing  quality of ir supervisory systems and for identifying future         work to achieve a baseline level of sound supervisory practices
 the core         principles are also used by  international monetary fund 
imf
 and  world         bank
 in  context of  financial sector assessment programme 
fsap
""
 to         assess  effectiveness of countries banking supervisory systems and practices
    01
2   in march 2011
  core principles group1 was mandated by  committee to         review and update  core principles
 the committees mandate was to conduct          review taking into account significant developments in  global financial         markets and regulatory landscape since october 2006 
when  core principles         had last been revised
""
 including post-crisis lessons for promoting sound         supervisory systems
 the intent was to ensure  continued relevance of          core principles for promoting effective banking supervision in all countries over         time and changing environments
      the core principles group consisted of members from  committee                     and  basel consultative group
 which comprises representatives                     from both committee and non-committee member countries and                     regional groups of banking supervisors
 as well as  imf
  world                     bank and  islamic financial services board
      see
 for example

        01
3   in conducting  2011 review
  committee sought to achieve  right         balance in raising  bar for sound supervision while retaining  core         principles as a flexible
 globally applicable standard
 by reinforcing          proportionality concept
  revised core principles and ir assessment criteria         accommodate a diverse range of banking systems
 the proportionate approach         also allows assessments of compliance with  core principles  are         commensurate with  risk profile and systemic importance of a broad spectrum         of banks 
from large internationally active banks to small
 non-complex deposit
        taking institutions
""
    01
4   both  core principles and  associated core principles methodology         
assessment methodology
 have served ir purpose well in terms of helping         countries to assess ir supervisory systems and identify areas for improvement
         while conscious efforts were made during  2011 review to maintain continuity         and comparability as far as possible
  committee merged  core principles         and  assessment methodology into a single comprehensive document
 the         revised set of twenty-nine core principles were also reorganised to foster ir         implementation through a more logical structure starting with supervisory         powers
 responsibilities and functions
 and followed by supervisory expectations         of banks
 emphasising  importance of good corporate governance and risk         management
 as well as compliance with supervisory standards
        the core principles methodology was separately developed in 1999                     and subsequently revised in 2006 to provide furr details and                     guidance on  assessment criteria and  assessment of compliance                     with  core principles
        01
5   important enhancements were introduced into  individual core principles         during  review
 particularly in those areas  are necessary to strengn         supervisory practices and risk management
 various additional criteria were         upgraded to essential criteria as a result
 while new assessment criteria were         warranted in or instances
 close attention was given to addressing many of          significant risk management weaknesses and or vulnerabilities highlighted         in  last crisis
 in addition
  review took account of several key trends and         developments  emerged during  last few years of market turmoil
  need         for greater intensity and resources to deal effectively with systemically important         banks
  importance of applying a system-wide
 macro perspective to          microprudential supervision of banks to assist in identifying
 analysing and taking         pre-emptive action to address systemic risk
 and  increasing focus on effective         crisis management
 recovery and resolution measures in reducing both          probability and impact of a bank failure
 the committee sought to give         appropriate emphasis to se emerging issues by embedding m into          core principles
 as appropriate
 and including specific references under each         relevant principle
    01
6   in addition
 sound corporate governance underpins effective risk management         and public confidence in individual banks and  banking system
 given         fundamental deficiencies in banks corporate governance  were exposed in          last crisis
 a new core principle on corporate governance was added in this         review by bringing toger existing corporate governance criteria in          assessment methodology and giving greater emphasis to sound corporate         governance practices
 similarly
  committee reiterated  key role of robust         market discipline in fostering a safe and sound banking system by expanding an         existing core principle into two new ones dedicated respectively to greater public         disclosure and transparency
 and enhanced financial reporting and external audit
    01
7   previously
  grading of compliance with  core principles was based solely         on  essential criteria
 to provide incentives to jurisdictions
 particularly those          are important financial centres
 to lead  way in  adoption of          highest supervisory standards
  revised core principles allow countries          additional option of voluntarily choosing to be assessed and graded against          essential and additional criteria
 in  same spirit of promoting full and robust         implementation
  committee retained  existing four-grade scale of         assessing compliance with  core principles
 this includes  current         materially non-compliant grading  helps provide a strong signalling effect         to relevant authorities on remedial measures needed for addressing supervisory         and regulatory shortcomings in ir countries
          01
8   the revised core principles continue to provide a comprehensive standard for         establishing a sound foundation for  regulation
 supervision
 governance and         risk management of  banking sector
 given  importance of consistent and         effective standards implementation
  committee stands ready to encourage         work at  national level to implement  revised core principles in conjunction         with or supervisory bodies and interested parties
      foreword to  core principles  01
9   the revised core principles strengn  requirements for supervisors
          approaches to supervision and supervisors expectations of banks
 this is         achieved through a greater focus on effective risk-based supervision and          need for early intervention and timely supervisory actions
 supervisors should         assess  risk profile of banks
 in terms of  risks y run
  efficacy of ir         risk management and  risks y pose to  banking and financial systems
         this risk-based process targets supervisory resources where y can be utilised         to  best effect
 focusing on outcomes as well as processes
 moving beyond         passive assessment of compliance with rules
    01
10 the core principles set out  powers  supervisors should have in order to        address safety and soundness concerns
 it is equally crucial  supervisors use        se powers once weaknesses or deficiencies are identified
 adopting a forward
       looking approach to supervision through early intervention can prevent an        identified weakness from developing into a threat to safety and soundness
 this        is particularly true for highly complex and bank-specific issues 
eg liquidity risk
        where effective supervisory actions must be tailored to a banks individual        circumstances
    01
11 in its efforts to strengn
 reinforce and refocus  core principles
         committee has noneless remained mindful of ir underlying purpose and        use
 the committees intention is to ensure  continued relevance of  core        principles in providing a benchmark for supervisory practices  will withstand         test of time and changing environments
 for this reason
 this revision of         core principles builds upon  preceding versions to ensure continuity and        comparability as far as possible
    01
12 in recognition of  universal applicability of  core principles
  committee        conducted its review in close cooperation with members of  basel consultative        group which comprises representatives from both committee and non
       committee member countries and regional groups of banking supervisors
 as        well as  imf
  world bank and  islamic financial services board
 the        committee consulted  industry and public before finalising  text
          general approach    01
13 the first core principle sets out  promotion of safety and soundness of banks        and  banking system as  primary objective for banking supervision
        jurisdictions may assign or responsibilities to  banking supervisor provided        y do not conflict with this primary objective
 it should not be an objective of        banking supervision to prevent bank failures
 however
 supervision should aim to        reduce  probability and impact of a bank failure
 including by working with        resolution authorities
 so  when failure occurs
 it is in an orderly manner
       the banking supervisor might
 for instance
 in some jurisdictions be                     tasked with responsibilities for
 
i
 depositor protection
 
ii
 financial                     stability
 
iii
 consumer protection
 or 
iv
 financial inclusion
      01
14 to fulfil ir purpose
  core principles must be capable of application to a        wide range of jurisdictions whose banking sectors will inevitably include a broad        spectrum of banks 
from large internationally active banks to small
 non-complex        deposit-taking institutions
""
 banking systems may also offer a wide range of        products or services and  core principles are aligned with  general aim of        catering to different financial needs
 to accommodate this breadth of application
        a proportionate approach is adopted
 both in terms of  expectations on        supervisors for  discharge of ir own functions and in terms of  standards         supervisors impose on banks
 consequently
  core principles        acknowledge  supervisors typically use a risk-based approach in which more        time and resources are devoted to larger
 more complex or riskier banks
 in         context of  standards imposed by supervisors on banks
  proportionality        concept is reflected in those principles focused on supervisors assessment of        banks risk management
 where  principles prescribe a level of supervisory        expectation commensurate with a banks risk profile and systemic importance
     in this document
 risk profile refers to  nature and scale of  risk                     exposures undertaken by a bank
    in this document
 systemic importance is determined by  size
                     interconnectedness
 substitutability
 global or cross-jurisdictional                     activity 
if any

 and complexity of  bank
 as set out in sco40

    01
15 successive revisions to existing committee standards and guidance
 and any new        standards and guidance will be designed to strengn  regulatory regime
        supervisors are encouraged to move towards  adoption of updated and new        international supervisory standards as y are issued
      approach toward emerging trends and developments    01
16 in  aftermath of  crisis
 much attention has been focused on systemically        important banks 
sibs
""
 and  regulations and supervisory powers needed to        deal with m effectively
 consideration was given by  committee during         2011 review to including a new core principle to cover sibs
 however
 it was        concluded  sibs
 which require greater intensity of supervision and hence        resources
 represent one end of  supervisory spectrum of banks
 each core        principle applies to  supervision of all banks
 the expectations on
 and of
        supervisors will need to be of a higher order for sibs
 commensurate with  risk        profile and systemic importance of se banks
 therefore
 it is unnecessary to        include a specific stand-alone core principle for sibs
    01
17 the crisis highlighted  interface between
 and  complementary nature of
         macroprudential and microprudential elements of effective supervision
 in        ir application of a risk-based supervisory approach
 supervisors and or        authorities need to assess risk in a broader context than  of  balance sheet        of individual banks
 for example
  prevailing macroeconomic environment
        business trends
 and  build-up and concentration of risk across  banking        sector and
 indeed
 outside of it
 inevitably impact  risk exposure of individual        banks
 bank-specific supervision should refore consider this macro        perspective
 individual bank data
 where appropriate
 data at sector level and        aggregate trend data collected by supervisors should be incorporated into         deliberations of authorities relevant for financial stability purposes 
wher part        of
 or separate from
  supervisor
 to assist in identification and analysis of        systemic risk
 the relevant authorities should have  ability to take pre-emptive        action to address systemic risks
 supervisors should have access to relevant        financial stability analyses or assessments conducted by or authorities         affect  banking system
 this broad financial system perspective is integral to        many of  core principles
 for this reason
  committee has not included a        specific stand-alone core principle on macroprudential issues
      01
18 in supervising an individual bank which is part of a corporate group
 it is essential         supervisors consider  bank and its risk profile from a number of        perspectives
 on a solo basis 
but with both a micro and macro focus as discussed        above
""
 on a consolidated basis 
in  sense of supervising  bank as a unit        toger with  or entities within  banking group
 and on a group
       wide basis 
taking into account  potential risks to  bank posed by or        group entities outside of  banking group
""
 group entities 
wher within or         outside  banking group
 may be a source of strength but y may also be a         source of weakness capable of adversely affecting  financial condition
         reputation and overall safety and soundness of  bank
 the core principles         include a specific core principle on  consolidated supervision of banking         groups
 but y also note  importance of parent companies and or non
        banking group entities in any assessment of  risks run by a bank or banking         group
 this supervisory risk perimeter extends beyond accounting consolidation         concepts
 in  discharge of ir functions
 supervisors must observe a broad         canvas of risk
 wher arising from within an individual bank
 from its associated         entities or from  prevailing macro financial environment
       in  bcp standard
 banking group includes  holding company
                      bank and its offices
 subsidiaries
 affiliates and joint ventures
 both                     domestic and foreign
 risks from or entities in  wider group
 for                     example non-bank 
including non-financial
 entities
 may also be                     relevant
 this group-wide approach to supervision goes beyond                     accounting consolidation
 the scope of consolidation used as  basis                     for all or basel requirements is set out in  sco standard
      01
19 supervisors should also remain alert to  movement
 or build-up
 of financial        activities outside  regulated banking sector 
 development of shadow        banking structures
 and  potential risks this may create
 data or information        on this should also be shared with any or authorities relevant for financial        stability purposes
    01
20 although it is not a supervisors role to prevent bank failures
 supervisory        oversight is designed to reduce both  probability and impact of such failures
        banks will
 from time to time
 run into difficulties
 and to minimise  adverse        impact both on  troubled bank and on  banking and financial sectors as a        whole
 effective crisis preparation and management
 and orderly resolution        frameworks and measures are required
 such measures may be viewed from two        perspectives
                 
1
  measures to be adopted by supervisory and or authorities 
including             developing resolution plans and in terms of information sharing and             cooperation with or authorities
 both domestic and cross-border
 to             coordinate an orderly restructuring or resolution of a troubled bank
""
 and           
2
 those to be adopted by banks 
including contingency funding plans and             recovery plans
 which should be subject to critical assessment by supervisors             as part of ir ongoing supervision
    01
21 to reflect
 and to emphasise
  importance of crisis management
 recovery and        resolution measures
 certain core principles include specific reference to         maintenance and assessment of contingency arrangements
    01
22 corporate governance shortcomings in banks
 examples of which were observed        during  crisis
 can have potentially serious consequences both for  bank        concerned and
 in some cases
 for  financial system as a whole
 similarly
         crisis served to underline  importance of disclosure and transparency in        maintaining confidence in banks by allowing market participants to understand        better a banks risk profile and reby reduce market uncertainties about         banks financial strength
      assessment of  core principles  01
23 the core principles establish a level of sound supervisory practice  can be        used as a benchmark by supervisors to assess  quality of ir supervisory        systems
 they are also used by  imf and  world bank
 in  context of         fsap
 to assess  effectiveness of countries banking supervisory systems and        practices
    01
24 the assessment methodology for  core principles includes both essential and        additional assessment criteria for each principle
           
1
 essential criteria set out minimum baseline requirements for sound             supervisory practices and are of universal applicability to all countries
 by             default
 for  purposes of grading
  essential criteria are  only             elements on which to gauge full compliance with a core principle
 an             assessment of a country against  essential criteria must
 however
             recognise  its supervisory practices should be commensurate with              risk profile and systemic importance of  banks being supervised
 in or             words
  assessment must consider  context in which  supervisory             practices are applied
 the concept of proportionality underpins all             assessment criteria even if it is not always directly referenced
                   
2
 the additional criteria are suggested best practices  countries having             advanced banks should aim for
 effective banking supervisory practices are             not static
 they evolve over time as lessons are learned and banking business             continues to develop and expand
 supervisors are often swift to encourage             banks to adopt best practice and supervisors should demonstrably             practice what y preach in terms of seeking to move continually towards              highest supervisory standards
 to reinforce this aspiration
  additional             criteria in  core principles set out supervisory practices  exceed             current baseline expectations but which will contribute to  robustness of             individual supervisory frameworks
 as supervisory practices evolve
 it is             expected  upon each revision of  core principles
 a number of             additional criteria will migrate to become essential criteria as expectations on             baseline standards change
 the use of essential criteria and additional             criteria will
 in this sense
 contribute to  continuing relevance of  core             principles over time
    01
25 in  past
 countries were graded only against  essential criteria
 although        y could volunteer to be assessed against  additional criteria too and benefit        from assessors commentary on how supervisory practices could be enhanced
 in        future
" countries undergoing assessments by  imf and/or  world bank can        elect to be graded against  essential and additional criteria"
 it is anticipated         this will provide incentives to jurisdictions
 particularly those  are        important financial centres
 to lead  way in  adoption of  highest        supervisory standards
 as with  essential criteria
 any assessment against        additional criteria should recognise  concept of proportionality as discussed        above
    01
26 it is important to bear in mind  some tasks
 such as a correct assessment of         macroeconomic environment and  detection of  build-up of dangerous        trends
" do not lend mselves to a rigid compliant/non-compliant structure"
        although se tasks may be difficult to assess
 supervisors should make        assessments  are as accurate as possible given  information available at         time and take reasonable actions to address and mitigate such risks
        01
27 while  publication of  assessments of jurisdictions affords transparency
 an        assessment of one jurisdiction will not be directly comparable to  of anor
        first
 assessments will have to reflect proportionality
 thus
 a jurisdiction  is        home to many sibs will naturally have a higher hurdle to obtain a compliant        grading versus a jurisdiction which only has small
 non-complex deposit-taking        institutions
 second
 with this version of  core principles
 jurisdictions can elect        to be graded against essential criteria only or against both essential criteria and        additional criteria
 third
 assessments will inevitably be country-specific and time
       dependent to varying degrees
 therefore
  description provided for each core        principle and  qualitative commentary accompanying  grading for each           core principle should be reviewed in order to gain an understanding of a         jurisdictions approach to  specific aspect under consideration and  need         for any improvements
 seeking to compare countries by a simple reference to          number of compliant versus non-compliant grades y receive is unlikely to         be informative
   see bcp01
51 on grading definitions
      01
28 from a broader perspective
 effective banking supervision is dependent on a        number of external elements
 or preconditions
 which may not be within         direct jurisdiction of supervisors
 thus
 in respect of grading
  assessment of        preconditions will remain qualitative and distinct from  assessment 
and        grading
 of compliance with  core principles
    01
29 core principle 29 dealing with  abuse of financial services includes
 among        or things
" supervision of banks anti-money laundering/combating         financing of terrorism "
"aml/cft"
 controls
 the committee recognises         assessments against this core principle will inevitably
 for some countries
 involve        a degree of duplication with  mutual evaluation process of  financial action        task force 
fatf
""
 to address this
 where an evaluation has recently been        conducted by  fatf on a given country
 fsap assessors may rely on         evaluation and focus ir own review on  actions taken by supervisors to        address any shortcomings identified by  fatf
 in  absence of any recent        fatf evaluation
" fsap assessors will continue to assess countries supervision of        banks aml/cft controls"
        consistency with standards for or financial sectors  01
30 the banking sector is only a part
 albeit an important part
 of a financial system
        the committee has sought to maintain consistency
 where possible
 between        se core principles and  corresponding standards for securities and        insurance
 as well as those for aml and transparency
 differences will
 however
        inevitably remain as key risk areas and supervisory priorities differ from sector to        sector
 in implementing  core principles
 supervisors should take into account         role of  banking sector in supporting and facilitating productive activities        for  real economy
      the core principles  01
31 the core principles are a framework of minimum standards for sound supervisory        practices and are considered universally applicable
 national authorities should        apply  core principles in  supervision of banking organisations within ir        jurisdictions
 the committee issued  core principles as its contribution to        strengning  global financial system
 weaknesses in  banking system of a        country
 wher developing or developed
 can threaten financial stability both        within  country and internationally
 the committee believes         implementation of  core principles by all countries would be a significant step        towards improving financial stability domestically and internationally
 and provide        a good basis for furr development of effective supervisory systems
 the vast        majority of countries have endorsed  core principles and have implemented        m
     the core principles are conceived as a voluntary framework of                     minimum standards for sound supervisory practices
 national                     authorities are free to put in place supplementary measures  y                     deem necessary to achieve effective supervision in ir jurisdictions
    in countries where non-bank financial institutions provide deposit and                     lending services similar to those of banks
 many of  principles set                     out in this document would also be appropriate to such non-bank                     financial institutions
 however
 it is also acknowledged  some of                     se categories of institutions may be regulated differently from banks                     as long as y do not hold
 collectively
 a significant proportion of                     deposits in a financial system
      01
32            the core principles define 29 principles  are needed for a supervisory system          to be effective
 those principles are broadly categorised into two groups
            
1
 principles 1 to 13 focus on powers
 responsibilities and functions of              supervisors
 while            
2
 principles 14 to 29 focus on prudential regulations and requirements for              banks
    01
33 the 29 core principles are
            
1
 principle 1  responsibilities
 objectives and powers
 an effective system of              banking supervision has clear responsibilities and objectives for each              authority involved in  supervision of banks and banking groups
 a              suitable legal framework for banking supervision is in place to provide each              responsible authority with  necessary legal powers to authorise banks
              conduct ongoing supervision
 address compliance with laws and undertake              timely corrective actions to address safety and soundness concerns
            
2

3
 principle 3  cooperation and collaboration
 laws
 regulations or or              arrangements provide a framework for cooperation and collaboration with              relevant domestic authorities and foreign supervisors

including  fitness and propriety of           board members and senior management
 of  bank and its wider group
           and its strategic and operating plan
 internal controls
 risk management and           projected financial condition

      this standard refers to a governance structure composed of a board                   and senior management
 the committee recognises  re are                   significant differences in  legislative and regulatory frameworks                   across countries regarding se functions
 some countries use a two
                  tier board structure
 where  supervisory function of  board is                   performed by a separate entity known as a supervisory board
 which                   has no executive functions
 or countries
 in contrast
 use a one-tier                   board structure in which  board has a broader role
 owing to se                   differences
 this document does not advocate a specific board structure

                    committee recognises  in a few countries se issues might be                   addressed by a separate licensing authority
       in  context of this principle
 prudential reports and statistical                   returns are distinct from and in addition to required accounting                   reports

     please refer to footnote 14
     for  purposes of assessing risk management by banks in  context                   of principles 15 to 25
 a banks risk management framework should                 take an integrated bank-wide perspective of  banks risk exposure
                 encompassing  banks individual business lines and business units
                 where a bank is a member of a group of companies
  risk                 management framework should in addition cover  risk exposure                 across and within  banking group 
see footnote 11
 and should                 also take account of risks posed to  bank or members of                  banking group through or entities in  wider group

                  supervisor is required to determine  banks risk management                 policies and processes are being adhered to
  responsibility for                 ensuring adherence remains with a banks board and senior                 management

      wherever interest rate risk is used in this principle  term refers to                 interest rate risk in  banking book
 interest rate risk in  trading                 book is covered under principle 22
      the committee has defined operational risk as  risk of loss resulting                 from inadequate or failed internal processes
 people and systems or                 from external events
 the definition includes legal risk but excludes                 strategic and reputational risk
      in assessing independence
 supervisors give due regard to  control                 systems designed to avoid conflicts of interest in  performance       measurement of staff in  compliance
 control and internal audit                     functions
 for example
  remuneration of such staff should be                     determined independently of  business lines  y oversee
        the committee is aware 
 in some jurisdictions
 or authorities
                     such as a financial intelligence unit
 rar than a banking supervisor
                     may have primary responsibility for assessing compliance with laws                     and regulations regarding criminal activities in banks
 such as fraud
                     money laundering and  financing of terrorism
 thus
 in  context                     of this principle
  supervisor might refer to such or authorities
                     in particular in essential criteria 7
 8 and 10
 in such jurisdictions
                      banking supervisor cooperates with such authorities to achieve                     adherence with  criteria mentioned in this principle
      01
34 the core principles are neutral with regard to different approaches to        supervision
 so long as  overriding goals are achieved
 they are not designed        to cover all  needs and circumstances of every banking system
 instead
        specific country circumstances should be more appropriately considered in         context of  assessments and in  dialogue between assessors and country        authorities
    01
35 a high degree of compliance with  core principles should foster overall        financial system stability
 however
 this will not guarantee it
 nor will it prevent         failure of banks
 banking supervision cannot
 and should not
 provide an        assurance  banks will not fail

36 the committee stands ready to encourage work at  national level to        implement  core principles in conjunction with or supervisory bodies and        interested parties
 the committee invites  international financial institutions        and donor agencies to use  core principles in assisting individual countries to        strengn ir supervisory arrangements
 the committee will continue to        collaborate closely with  imf and  world bank in ir monitoring of         implementation of  committees prudential standards
 the committee also        remains committed to furr enhancing its interaction with supervisors from        non-member countries
          preconditions for effective banking supervision  01
37 an effective system of banking supervision needs to be able to effectively        develop
 implement
 monitor and enforce supervisory policies under normal and        stressed economic and financial conditions
 supervisors need to be able to        respond to external conditions  can negatively affect banks or  banking        system
 there are a number of elements or preconditions  have a direct        impact on  effectiveness of supervision in practice
 these preconditions are        mostly outside  direct or sole jurisdiction of banking supervisors
 where        supervisors have concerns   preconditions could impact  efficiency or        effectiveness of regulation and supervision of banks
 supervisors should make         government and relevant authorities aware of m and ir actual or potential        negative repercussions for supervisory objectives
 supervisors should work with         government and relevant authorities to address concerns  are outside         direct or sole jurisdiction of  supervisors
 supervisors should also
 as part of        ir normal business
 adopt measures to address  effects of such concerns on         efficiency or effectiveness of regulation and supervision of banks
    01
38 the preconditions include
           
1
 sound and sustainable macroeconomic policies
           
2
 a well established framework for financial stability policy formulation
           
3
 a well developed public infrastructure
           
4
 a clear framework for crisis management
 recovery and resolution
           
5
 an appropriate level of systemic protection 
or public safety net
""
 and           
6
 effective market discipline
    01
39 sound macroeconomic policies 
mainly fiscal and monetary policies
 are         foundation of a stable financial system
 without sound policies
 imbalances such        as high government borrowing and spending
 and an excessive shortage or        supply of liquidity
 may arise and affect  stability of  financial system
        furr
 certain government policies may specifically use banks and or        financial intermediaries as instruments
 which may inhibit effective supervision
      examples of such policies include accumulation of large quantities of                    government securities
 reduced access to capital markets due to                    government controls or growing imbalances
 degradation in asset                    quality after loose monetary policies
 and government-directed lending                    or forbearance requirements as an economic policy response to                    deteriorating economic conditions
      01
40 in view of  impact and interplay between  real economy and banks and         financial system
 it is important  re exists a clear framework for        macroprudential surveillance and financial stability policy formulation
 such a        framework should set out  authorities or those responsible for identifying        systemic and emerging risks in  financial system
 monitoring and analysing        market and or financial and economic factors  may lead to accumulation        of systemic risks
 formulating and implementing appropriate policies
 and        assessing how such policies may affect  banks and  financial system
 it        should also include mechanisms for effective cooperation and coordination        among  relevant agencies
    01
41 a well developed public infrastructure needs to comprise  following elements
        which
 if not adequately provided
 can contribute to  weakening of financial        systems and markets
 or frustrate ir improvement
          
1
 a system of business laws
 including corporate
 bankruptcy
 contract
            consumer protection and private property laws
 which is consistently            enforced and provides a mechanism for  fair resolution of disputes
          
2
 an efficient and independent judiciary
          
3
 comprehensive and well defined accounting principles and rules  are            widely accepted internationally
          
4
 a system of independent external audits
 to ensure  users of financial            statements
 including banks
 have independent assurance   accounts            provide a true and fair view of  financial position of  company and are            prepared according to established accounting principles
 with auditors held            accountable for ir work
          
5
 availability of competent
 independent and experienced professionals 
eg            accountants
 auditors and lawyers
""
 whose work complies with transparent            technical and ethical standards set and enforced by official or professional            bodies consistent with international standards
 and who are subject to            appropriate oversight
           
6
 well defined rules governing
 and adequate supervision of
 or financial             markets and
 where appropriate
 ir participants
           
7
 secure
 efficient and well regulated payment and clearing systems 
including             central counterparties
 for  settlement of financial transactions where             counterparty risks are effectively controlled and managed
           
8
" efficient and effective credit bureaus  make available credit information             on borrowers and/or databases  assist in  assessment of risks"
 and           
9
 public availability of basic economic
 financial and social statistics
    01
42 effective crisis management frameworks and resolution regimes help to minimise        potential disruptions to financial stability arising from banks and financial        institutions  are in distress or failing
 a sound institutional framework for crisis        management and resolution requires a clear mandate and an effective legal        underpinning for each relevant authority 
such as banking supervisors
 national        resolution authorities
 finance ministries and central banks
""
 the relevant        authorities should have a broad range of powers and appropriate tools provided        in law to resolve a financial institution  is no longer viable and where re is        no reasonable prospect of it becoming viable
 there should also be agreement        among  relevant authorities on ir individual and joint responsibilities for        crisis management and resolution
 and how y will discharge se        responsibilities in a coordinated manner
 this should include  ability to share        confidential information among one anor to facilitate planning in advance to        handle recovery and resolution situations and to manage such events when y        occur
    01
43 deciding on  appropriate level of systemic protection is a policy question to        be addressed by  relevant authorities
 including  government and central        bank
 particularly where it may result in a commitment of public funds
        supervisors will have an important role to play because of ir in-depth        knowledge of  financial institutions involved
 in handling systemic issues
 it is        necessary to balance several factors
 addressing  risks to confidence in         financial system and contagion to orwise sound institutions and
 minimising         distortion to market signals and discipline
 a key element of  framework        for systemic protection is a system of deposit insurance
 provided such a system        is transparent and carefully designed
 it can contribute to public confidence in         system and thus limit contagion from banks in distress
      01
44 effective market discipline depends
 in part
 on adequate flows of information to        market participants
 appropriate financial incentives to reward well managed        institutions
 and arrangements  ensure  investors are not insulated from         consequences of ir decisions
 among  issues to be addressed are           corporate governance and ensuring  accurate
 meaningful
 transparent and         timely information is provided by borrowers to investors and creditors
 market         signals can be distorted and discipline undermined if governments seek to         influence or override commercial decisions
 particularly lending decisions
 to         achieve public policy objectives
 in se circumstances
 it is important 
 if         governments or ir related entities provide or guarantee  lending
 such         arrangements are disclosed and re is a formal process for compensating         financial institutions when such loans cease to perform
      assessment methodology  01
45 the core principles are mainly intended to help countries assess  quality of        ir systems and to provide input into ir reform agenda
 an assessment of         current situation of a countrys compliance with  core principles can be        considered a useful tool in a countrys implementation of an effective system of        banking supervision
 in order to achieve objectivity and comparability of        compliance with  core principles in  different country assessments
        supervisors and assessors should refer to this assessment methodology
 which        does not eliminate  need for both parties to use ir judgment in assessing        compliance
 such an assessment should identify weaknesses in  existing        system of supervision and regulation
 and form a basis for remedial measures by        government authorities and banking supervisors
       the aim of assessments is
 however
 not for ranking supervisory                     systems
 please refer to bcp01

      01
46 although committee members individually collaborate in assessment missions
        se are conducted primarily by  imf and  world bank
 the committee        has decided not to make assessments of its own to maintain  current division        of labour between  committees standard-setting and  international        financial institutions assessment functions
 however
  committee
 toger        with  financial stability institute
 is prepared to assist in or ways
 for        example by providing training
      use of  methodology      01
47 the methodology can be used in multiple contexts
           
1
 self-assessments performed by banking supervisors mselves
           
2
 imf and world bank assessments of  quality of supervisory systems
 for             example in  context of fsap
           
3
 reviews conducted by private third parties such as consulting firms
 or           
4
 peer reviews conducted
 for instance
 within regional groupings of banking             supervisors
       the committee has issued guidelines for performing self-assessments
                     conducting a supervisory self-assessment  practical application
 basel
                     april 2001
     the regular reports by  imf and  world bank on  lessons                     drawn from assessment experiences as part of fsap exercises                     constitute a useful source of information which has been used as an                     input to improve  principles
      01
48 whatever  context
  following factors are crucial
           
1
 in order to achieve full objectivity
 compliance with  core principles is             best assessed by suitably qualified external parties consisting of two             individuals with strong supervisory backgrounds who bring varied             perspectives so as to provide checks and balances
 however
 experience has             shown  a recent self-assessment is a highly useful input to an outside             party assessment
           
2
 a fair assessment of  banking supervisory process cannot be performed             without  genuine cooperation of all relevant authorities
           
3
 the process of assessing each of  29 core principles requires a             judgmental weighing of numerous elements  only qualified assessors             with practical
 relevant experience can provide
           
4
 the assessment requires some legal and accounting expertise in              interpretation of compliance with  core principles
 se legal and             accounting interpretations must be in relation to  legislative and             accounting structure of  relevant country
 they may also require              advice of additional legal and accounting experts
 which can be sought             subsequent to  on-site assessment
           
5
 the assessment must be comprehensive and in sufficient depth to allow a             judgment on wher criteria are fulfilled in practice
 not just in ory
 laws             and regulations need to be sufficient in scope and depth
 and be effectively             enforced and complied with
 their existence alone does not provide enough             indication   criteria are met
      assessment of compliance    01
49 the primary objective of an assessment should be  identification of  nature        and extent of any weaknesses in  banking supervisory system and compliance        with individual core principles
 while  process of implementing  core        principles starts with  assessment of compliance
 assessment is a means to an        end
 not an objective in itself
 instead
  assessment will allow  supervisory        authority 
and in some instances  government
 to initiate a strategy to        improve  banking supervisory system
 as necessary
    01
50 to assess compliance with a principle
 this methodology proposes a set of        essential and additional assessment criteria for each principle
 by default
 for         purposes of grading
  essential criteria are  only elements on which to        gauge full compliance with a core principle
 the additional criteria are suggested        best practices  countries having advanced banks should aim for
 countries        have  following three assessment options
           
1
 unless  country explicitly opts for any or option
 compliance with              core principles will be assessed and graded only with reference to              essential criteria
           
2
 a country may voluntarily choose to be assessed against  additional             criteria
 in order to identify areas in which it could enhance its regulation and             supervision furr and benefit from assessors commentary on how it could             be achieved
 however
 compliance with  core principles will still be             graded only with reference to  essential criteria
 or           
3
 to accommodate countries  furr seek to attain best supervisory             practices
 a country may voluntarily choose to be assessed and graded             against  additional criteria
 in addition to  essential criteria
  01
51            for assessments of  core principles by external parties
  following four
         grade scale will be used
 a not applicable grading can be used under certain          circumstances as described in bcp01
52
            
1
 compliant  a country will be considered compliant with a principle when all              essential criteria  applicable for this country are met without any significant              deficiencies
 there may be instances
 of course
 where a country can              demonstrate   principle has been achieved by or means
              conversely
 due to  specific conditions in individual countries
               essential criteria may not always be sufficient to achieve  objective of               principle
 and refore or measures may also be needed in order for               aspect of banking supervision addressed by  principle to be considered              effective
            
2
 largely compliant  a country will be considered largely compliant with a              principle whenever only minor shortcomings are observed  do not raise              any concerns about  authoritys ability and clear intent to achieve full              compliance with  principle within a prescribed period of time
 the              assessment largely compliant can be used when  system does not meet              all essential criteria
 but  overall effectiveness is sufficiently good
 and no              material risks are left unaddressed
            
3
 materially non-compliant  a country will be considered materially non
             compliant with a principle whenever re are severe shortcomings
 despite               existence of formal rules
 regulations and procedures
 and re is              evidence  supervision has clearly not been effective
  practical              implementation is weak
 or   shortcomings are sufficient to raise              doubts about  authoritys ability to achieve compliance
 it is              acknowledged   gap between largely compliant and materially              non-compliant is wide
 and   choice may be difficult
 on  or              hand
  intention has been to force  assessors to make a clear              statement
            
4
 non-compliant  a country will be considered non-compliant with a              principle whenever re has been no substantive implementation of               principle
 several essential criteria are not complied with or supervision is              manifestly ineffective
           while gradings of self-assessments may provide useful information to                      authorities
 se are not mandatory as  assessors will arrive at                     ir own independent judgment
     for  purpose of grading
 references to  term essential criteria in                     this paragraph would include additional criteria in  case of a                     country  has volunteered to be assessed and graded against                      additional criteria
      01
52 in addition
 a principle will be considered not applicable when
 in  view of         assessor
  principle does not apply given  structural
 legal and        institutional features of a country
 in some instances countries have argued         in  case of certain embryonic or immaterial banking activities
 which were not        being supervised
 an assessment of not applicable should have been given
        rar than non-compliant
 this is an issue for judgment by  assessor
        although activities  are relatively insignificant at  time of assessment may        later assume greater importance and authorities need to be aware of
 and        prepared for
 such developments
 the supervisory system should permit such        activities to be monitored
 even if no regulation or supervision is considered        immediately necessary
 not applicable would be an appropriate assessment if         supervisors are aware of  phenomenon
 and would be capable of taking        action
 but re is realistically no chance   activities will grow sufficiently        in volume to pose a risk
    01
53 grading is not an exact science and  core principles can be met in different        ways
 the assessment criteria should not be seen as a checklist approach to        compliance but as a qualitative exercise
 compliance with some criteria may be        more critical for effectiveness of supervision
 depending on  situation and        circumstances in a given jurisdiction
 hence
  number of criteria complied with        is not always an indication of  overall compliance rating for any given        principle
 emphasis should be placed on  commentary  should accompany        each principle grading
 rar than on  grading itself
 the primary goal of         exercise is not to apply a grade but rar to focus authorities on areas needing        attention in order to set  stage for improvements and develop an action plan         prioritises  improvements needed to achieve full compliance with         core principles
    01
54 the assessment should also include  assessors opinion on how weaknesses in         preconditions for effective banking supervision
 as discussed in bcp01
37 to        bcp01
44
 hinder effective supervision and how effectively supervisory measures        mitigate se weaknesses
 in particular
  assessment of compliance with        individual core principles should mention clearly how it is likely to be primarily        affected by preconditions  are considered to be weak
 this opinion should be         qualitative rar than providing any kind of graded assessment
 to  extent         shortcomings in preconditions are material to  effectiveness of supervision
         y may affect  grading of  affected core principles

55 the core principles are minimum standards to be applied by all banking        supervisors
 in implementing some of m
 supervisors will need to take into        account  risk profile and systemic importance of individual banks
 particularly        for those core principles where supervisors have to determine  adequacy of        banks
risk management policies and processes
      practical considerations in conducting an assessment    01
56 while  committee does not have a specific role in setting out detailed        guidelines on  preparation and presentation of assessment reports
 it believes        re are a few considerations  assessors should take into account when        conducting an assessment and preparing  assessment report
 by way of        example
 bcp01
135 to bcp01
155 includes  format developed by  imf and         world bank for conducting ir own assessments of  state of        implementation of  core principles in individual countries
 this section also        includes structured guidance to  assessors on how to form an opinion on         preconditions for effective banking supervision
 how weaknesses in se external        elements may hinder supervision
 as mentioned in bcp01
54 and how effective        supervisory measures can mitigate shortcomings in  preconditions for        effective banking supervision
          01
57 first
 when conducting an assessment
  assessor must have free access to a        range of information and interested parties
 the required information may        include not only published information
 such as  relevant laws
 regulations and        policies
 but also more sensitive information
 such as any self-assessments
        operational guidelines for supervisors and
 where possible
 supervisory        assessments of individual banks
 this information should be provided as long as        it does not violate legal requirements for supervisors to hold such information        confidential
 experience from assessments has shown  secrecy issues can        often be solved through ad hoc arrangements between  assessor and         assessed authority
 the assessor will need to meet with a range of individuals and        organisations
 including  banking supervisory authority or authorities
 or        domestic supervisory authorities
 any relevant government ministries
 bankers        and bankers associations
 auditors and or financial sector participants
 special         note should be made of instances when any required information is not provided
         as well as of what impact this might have on  accuracy of  assessment
    01
58 second
  assessment of compliance with each core principle requires         evaluation of a chain of related requirements which
 depending on  principle
        may encompass law
 prudential regulation
 supervisory guidelines
 on-site        examinations and off-site analysis
 supervisory reporting and public disclosures
        and evidence of enforcement or non-enforcement
 furr
  assessment must        ensure   requirements are put into practice
 this also requires assessing        wher  supervisory authority has  necessary operational autonomy
 skills
        resources and commitment to implement  core principles
    01
59 third
 assessments should not focus solely on deficiencies but should also        highlight specific achievements
 this approach will provide a better picture of         effectiveness of banking supervision
    01
60 fourth
 re are certain jurisdictions where non-bank financial institutions         are not part of a supervised banking group engage in some bank-like activities
        se institutions may make up a significant portion of  total financial system        and may be largely unsupervised
 since  core principles deal specifically with        banking supervision
 y cannot be used for formal assessments of se non
       bank financial institutions
 however
  assessment report should
 at a minimum
        mention those activities where non-banks have an impact on  supervised        banks and  potential problems  may arise as a result of non-bank activities
      01
61 fifth
  development of cross-border banking leads to increased complications        when conducting core principles assessments
 improved cooperation and        information sharing between home and host country supervisors is of central        importance
 both in normal times and in crisis situations
 the assessor must        refore determine  such cooperation and information sharing actually takes        place to  extent needed
 bearing in mind  size and complexity of         banking links between  two countries
      criteria for assessing compliance with  core principles  01
62 this section lists  assessment criteria for each of  29 core principles under        two separate headings
 essential criteria and additional criteria
 as mentioned        in bcp01
50
 essential criteria are those elements  should be present in order        to demonstrate compliance with a principle
 additional criteria may be        particularly relevant to  supervision of more sophisticated banking        organisations
 and countries with such institutions should aim to achieve m
        by and large
  compliance grading will be based on  essential criteria
         assessor will comment on
 but not grade
 compliance with  additional criteria        unless  country undergoing  assessment has voluntarily chosen to be        graded against  additional criteria too
    01
63 the individual assessment criteria are based on sound supervisory practices        already established
 even if y are not yet fully implemented
 where        appropriate
  documents on which  criteria are founded have been cited
      principle 1  responsibilities
 objectives and powers    01
64 principle 1
 an effective system of banking supervision has clear responsibilities        and objectives for each authority involved in  supervision of banks and        banking groups
 a suitable legal framework for banking supervision is in place to        provide each responsible authority with  necessary legal powers to authorise        banks

101 essential criteria
           
1
 laws
 regulations or  supervisor require banks to calculate and             consistently observe prescribed capital requirements
 including thresholds by             reference to which a bank might be subject to supervisory action
 laws
             regulations or  supervisor define  qualifying components of capital
             ensuring  emphasis is given to those elements of capital permanently             available to absorb losses on a going concern basis
           
2
 at least for internationally active banks
  definition of capital
  risk             coverage

" the supervisor has  power to impose a specific capital charge and/or             limits on all material risk exposures"
 if warranted
 including in respect of risks               supervisor considers not to have been adequately transferred or             mitigated through transactions 
eg securitisation transactions
 entered into             by  bank
 both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet risks are included             in  calculation of prescribed capital requirements
           
4
 the prescribed capital requirements reflect  risk profile and systemic             importance of banks in  context of  markets and macroeconomic             conditions in which y operate and constrain  build-up of leverage in             banks and  banking sector
 laws and regulations in a particular             jurisdiction may set higher overall capital adequacy standards than              applicable basel requirements

c
    supervisor has  capacity to evaluate a banks internal assessment                 process in order to determine   relevant qualifying standards are                 met and   banks internal assessments can be relied upon as a                 reasonable reflection of  risks undertaken
             
d
  supervisor has  power to impose conditions on its approvals if                supervisor considers it prudent to do so
 and             
e
 if a bank does not continue to meet  qualifying standards or                conditions imposed by  supervisor on an ongoing basis
                supervisor has  power to revoke its approval

d
  quality of its risk                     management and controls
 consequently
 capital requirements may                     vary from bank to bank to ensure  each bank is operating with                      appropriate level of capital to support  risks it is running and                      risks it poses
    stress testing comprises a range of activities from simple sensitivity                     analysis to more complex scenario analyses and reverse stress testing

136 the bcp assessment report should be divided into seven parts
 as listed below
        the following paragraphs provide a brief description of each of  seven parts
           
1
 a general section providing background information and information on              methodology used           
2
 an overview of institutional setting and market infrastructure           
3
 a review of preconditions for effective banking supervision           
4
 detailed principle-by-principle assessments           
5
 a compliance table summarising  results of  assessment           
6
 a recommended action plan           
7
 authoritys response    01
137 a general section provides background information on  assessment        conducted
 ie
  context in which  assessment is being conducted and         methodology used
 this section should
           
1
 indicate   scope of  assessment has been selected with              authorities agreement
 mentioning in particular wher  authorities             agreed to be assessed and graded on  basis of only  essential criteria             or agreed to be assessed and graded using additional criteria too
" in              case of risk-based/targeted assessments"
 this section must also indicate              principles  are reassessed and  reasons for  reassessment
 the             names and affiliations of  assessors should be mentioned in this section
             
2
 mention  sources used for  assessment such as any self-assessments
             questionnaires filled out by  authorities
 relevant laws
 regulations and              instructions
 or documentation such as reports
 studies
 public              statements
 websites
 unpublished guidelines
 directives
 supervisory reports              and assessments
           
3
 identify counterparty authorities and mention
 in a generic way
 senior             officials with whom interviews were held
 meetings with or domestic             supervisory authorities
 private sector participants
 or relevant             government authorities or industry associations 
such as bankers             associations
 auditors and accountants
""
           
4
 mention factors  impeded or facilitated  assessment
 in particular
             information gaps 
such as lack of access to supervisory materials
 or             translated documents
 should be mentioned
 and an indication given of              extent to which se gaps may have affected  assessment
        names are typically avoided
 in order to protect individuals and                     encourage candour
     if  lack of information adversely impacts  quality and depth of                      assessment of a particular principle
 assessors should refer to this in                      comment section of  assessment template
 and document                      obstacles encountered
 in particular where access to in-depth                     information is crucial in evaluating compliance
 such issues should be                     brought to  attention of  mission leaders and when necessary                     referred to headquarters staff for guidance
      01
138 the second section should provide an overview of  supervisory environment        for  financial sector
 with a brief description of  institutional and legal        setting
 in particular  mandate and oversight roles of different supervisory        authorities
 existence of unregulated financial intermediaries
 and  role of self
       regulatory organisations
 furrmore
 it should provide a general description of         structure of  financial markets and
 in particular
  banking sector
        mentioning  number of banks
 total assets to gross domestic product
 basic        review of banking stability
 capital adequacy
 leverage
 asset quality
 liquidity
        profitability and risk profile of  sector
 and information on ownership
 ie
        foreign versus domestic
 state-owned versus privately-owned
 existence of        conglomerates or unregulated affiliates
 and similar information
        01
139 the third section should provide an overview of  preconditions for effective        banking supervision
 as described in this bcp standard
 experience has shown          insufficient implementation of  preconditions can seriously undermine          quality and effectiveness of banking supervision
 assessors should aim to give a         factual review of preconditions so   reader of  report is able to clearly         understand  environment in which  banking system and  supervisory         framework are operating
 this will provide  perspective for a better         appreciation of  assessment and grading of individual principles
 the review         normally should take up no more than one or two paragraphs for each type of         precondition
 and should follow  headings indicated below
           
1
 sound and sustainable macroeconomic policies
  review should describe             those aspects  could affect  structure and performance of  banking             system
 and should not express an opinion on  adequacy of policies in             se areas
 it may make reference to analyses and recommendations in             existing imf and world bank documents
 such as article iv and or bank             and fund program-related reports
           
2
 a well established framework for financial stability policy formulation
              review should indicate  existence or orwise of a clear framework for             macroprudential surveillance and policy stability formulation
 it should cover              elements of clarity of roles and mandates of  relevant agencies
              mechanisms for effective inter-agency cooperation and coordination
             communication of  macroprudential analyses
 risks
 and policies
 and ir             outcomes
 assessors may rely on independent assessments of  adequacy             and effectiveness of  framework
 where available
           
3
 a well developed public infrastructure
 a factual review of  public             infrastructure should focus on elements relevant to  banking system and
             where appropriate
 be prepared in coordination with or specialists on              mission and  imf-world bank country teams
 this part of  review of              preconditions could cover issues such as  presence of a good credit             culture
 a system of business laws including corporate
 bankruptcy
 contract
             consumer protection and private property laws  is consistently enforced             and provides a mechanism for  fair resolution of disputes
  presence of             well trained and reliable accounting
 auditing and legal professions
 an             effective and reliable judiciary
 an adequate financial sector regulation
 and             efficient payment
 clearing and settlement systems
           
4
 a clear framework for crisis management
 recovery and resolution
  review           should cover  availability of a sound institutional framework for crisis           management and resolution of banks
 and  clarity of  roles and           mandates of  relevant agencies
 while evidence of  effectiveness may           be observed in  actual management and resolution of past crisis
 it may           be also available from documentation of  outcomes of crisis simulation           exercises conducted in  jurisdiction
 assessors may rely on independent           assessments of  adequacy and effectiveness of  framework
 where           available
         
5
 an appropriate level of systemic protection 
or public safety net
""
 an           overview of  safety nets or systemic protection could
 for instance
 include            following elements
 an analysis of  functions of  various entities           involved such as supervisory authorities
 deposit insurer and central bank
           this would be followed by a review of  existence of a well defined process           for dealing with crisis situations such as  resolution of a failed financial           institution
 this would be combined with a description of  coordination of            roles of  various involved entities within this process
 additionally
 in           connection with  use of public funds 
including central bank funds
 a           review of wher sufficient measures are in place to minimise moral hazard           would be conducted
 also
  mechanisms to meet banks
temporary short
          term liquidity needs
 primarily through  interbank market
 but also from           or sources
 would need to be described
         
6
 effective market discipline
 a review of market discipline could
 for instance
           cover issues such as  presence of rules on corporate governance
           transparency and audited financial disclosure
 appropriate incentive           structures for  hiring and removal of managers and board members
           protection of shareholders rights
 adequate availability of market and           consumer information
 disclosure of government influence in banks
 tools for            exercise of market discipline such as mobility of deposits and or           assets held in banks
 adequate periodicity of interest rate and or price           quotes
 an effective framework for mergers
 takeovers
 and acquisitions of           equity interests
 possibility of foreign entry into  markets and foreign
          financed takeovers
        01
140 bcp assessors should not undertake to assess preconditions mselves
 as this is        beyond  scope of  individual standard assessments
 assessors should rely        to  greatest extent possible on official imf and world bank documents and        seek to ensure   brief description and comments are consistent
 when        relevant
  assessors should attempt to include in ir analysis  linkages        between se factors and  effectiveness of supervision
 as described in         next section
  assessment of compliance with individual core principles should        mention clearly how it is likely to be primarily affected by preconditions  are        considered to be weak
 to  extent shortcomings in preconditions are material         to  effectiveness of supervision
 y may affect  grading of  affected         core principles
 any suggestions aimed at addressing deficiencies in         preconditions are not part of  recommendations of  assessment but can be         made into general fsap recommendations within  scope of  fsap exercise
    01
141 the fourth section contains a detailed principle-by-principle assessment
        providing a description of  system with regard to each criterion within a        principle
 a grading or assessment
 and comments
 the template for         detailed assessment is structured as follows
            principle 
x
 
repeating verbatim  text of  principle
            essential criteria            description and findings regarding ec1            description and findings regarding ec2            description and findings regarding ecn            additional criteria

142 the description and findings section of  template should provide        information on  practice as observed in  country being assessed
 it should        cite and summarise  main elements of  relevant laws and regulations
 this               should be done in such a way   relevant law or regulation can be easily         located
 for instance by reference to urls
 official gazettes
 and similar sources
         insofar as possible and relevant
  description should be structured as follows
           
1
 banking laws and supporting regulations
           
2
 prudential regulations
 including prudential reports and public disclosure
           
3
 supervisory tools and instruments
           
4
 institutional capacity of  supervisory authority
 and           
5
" evidence of implementation and/or enforcement or  lack of it"
    01
"143 evidence of implementation and/or enforcement is essential "
without effective        use of powers vested in  supervisor and implementation of rules and        regulations
 even a well designed supervisory system will not be effective
        examples of practical implementation should be provided by  authorities
        reviewed by  assessors
 and mentioned in  report
     for instance
 how many times over  past years have  authorities                     applied corrective action? how frequently have banks been inspected                     on-site? how many licensing applications have been received
" and how                     many have been accepted/turned down? have asset quality reports                     been prepared by  inspectors"
 and how have  conclusions been                     communicated to senior bank and banking supervision management?      01
144 the assessment section of  template should contain only one line
 stating        wher  system is compliant
 largely compliant
 materially non
       compliant
 non-compliant or not applicable as described in bcp01
51 and        bcp01
52
          01
145 the essential criteria set out minimum baseline requirements for sound        supervisory practices and are of universal applicability to all countries
 an        assessment of a jurisdiction against  essential criteria must
 however
        recognise  its supervisory practices should be commensurate with  risk        profile and systemic importance of  banks being supervised
 in or words
           assessment must consider  context in which  supervisory practices are        applied
 as with  essential criteria
 any assessment against additional criteria        should also adopt  principle of proportionality
 this principle should underpin        assessment of all criteria even if it is not always explicitly referred to in         criteria
 for example
 a jurisdiction with many systemically important banks or        banks  are part of complex mixed conglomerates will naturally have a higher        hurdle to obtain a compliant grading as compared to a jurisdiction which only        has small and non-complex banks  are primarily engaged in deposit taking        and extending loans
    01
146 the comments section of  template should be used to explain why a        particular grading was given
 in case of a less than compliant grading
 this        section should be used to highlight  materiality of  observed shortcomings        and indicate which measures would be needed to achieve full compliance or a        higher level of compliance
 this should also be included in  table on        recommended actions 
see below
""
 this reasoning could be structured as        follows
          
1
  state of  laws and regulations and ir implementation
          
2
  state of  supervisory tools and instruments
 for instance reporting            formats
 early warning systems and inspection manuals
          
3
  quality of practical implementation
          
4
  state of  institutional capacity of  supervisory authority
 and          
5
 enforcement practices
    01
147 the comments should explain  cases where
 despite  existence of laws
        regulations and policies
 weaknesses in implementation contributed to         principle being graded less than compliant
 conversely
 when a compliant        grading was given
 but observance was demonstrated through different        mechanisms by  country
 this should be explained
 the comments section        should also highlight when and why compliance of a particular criterion could not        be adequately reviewed
 such as when certain information was not provided
 or        when key individuals were unavailable to discuss important issues
 requests for        information or meetings should be documented in  comments section
 to        clearly demonstrate  assessors attempts to adequately assess a principle
      01
148 assessors may also include comments where y find particularly good        practices or rules in some field
 which may serve as examples and best practice to        or countries
 planned initiatives aimed at amending existing or adopting new        regulations and practices
 but which are not yet in effect
 can receive favourable        mention in this section
 recent legislative
 regulatory or supervisory initiatives for        which implementation could not be verified should be mentioned in this section        as well
    01
149 the assessment and accompanying grades should solely be based on         regulatory framework and supervisory practices in place at  time of         assessment
 and should not reflect planned initiatives aimed at amending existing        or adopting new regulations and practices
 this would be applicable in  case        where actions are in process  would result in a higher compliance rating
 but        have not yet been effected or implemented
    01
150 when linkages between particular principles are evident
 or between        preconditions and principles
 this section should be used to caution  reader        
 although  regulation and practices in principle 
x
 seem compliant
 a        compliant grading cannot be given because of material deficiencies in         implementation of principle 
y
 or precondition 
z
""
 while recognising  re        could be common deficiencies which are both relevant and material enough to        affect  rating of more than one principle
 assessors should avoid double
       counting as far as possible
 if  deficiencies found in linked principles or        preconditions are not material enough to warrant a downgrade
 this should still        be brought out in this section of  template
     for example
 regulation and supervision on capital adequacy may                     seem compliant
 but if material deficiencies are found in anor                     principle
 such as provisioning
  will mean capital may be                     overstated and ratios unreliable
      01
151 grading to a principle should be given regardless of  level of development of        a country
 if certain criteria are not applicable given  size
 nature of operations        and complexity of a countrys banking system
 grading for  principle should be        based on level of compliance with  applicable criteria only
 this must be        clearly explained in  relevant section of  report so  a future review can        reconsider  grading if  situation changes
 the same applies to a not
       applicable grading to a principle
    01
152 the fifth section of  report comprises a compliance table
 summarising         assessments
 principle-by-principle
 this table has two versions
  one  does           not include explicit grading

153 the sixth section comprises a recommended actions table providing principle
       by-principle recommendations for actions and measures to improve         regulatory and supervisory framework and practices
 this section should list         suggested steps for improving compliance and overall effectiveness of         supervisory framework
 recommendations should be proposed on a prioritised        basis in each case where deficiencies are identified
 the recommended actions        should be specific in nature
 an explanation could also be provided as to how         recommended action would lead to improving  level of compliance and        strengning of  supervisory framework
 the institutional responsibility for        each suggested action should also be clearly indicated in order to prevent        overlap or confusion
 recommendations can also be made with regard to        deficiencies in compliance with  additional criteria and to principles which are        fully compliant but where supervisory practice can still be improved
 the table        should indicate only those principles for which specific recommendations are        being made

154 the seventh section describes  authorities response to  assessment
 the        assessor should provide  supervisory authority or authorities being assessed        with an opportunity to respond to  assessment findings
 which would include        providing  authorities with a full written draft of  assessment
 any        differences of opinion on  assessment results should be clearly identified and        included in  report
 the assessment should allow for greater dialogue
 and        refore  assessment team should have had a number of discussions with         supervisors during  assessment process so   assessment should also        reflect  comments
 concerns and factual corrections of  supervisors
 the        authority or authorities should also be requested to prepare a concise written        response to  findings 
right of reply

 the assessment should not
 however
        become  object of negotiations
 and assessors and authorities should be        willing to agree to disagree
 provided  authorities views are represented        fairly and accurately
             if no such response is provided within a reasonable time frame
                      assessors should note this explicitly and provide a brief summary of                      authorities initial response provided during  discussion between                      authorities and  assessors at  end of  assessment mission
