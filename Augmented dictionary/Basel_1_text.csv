    basle committee on banking supervision      international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards      basle july 1988        international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards      introduction  1
    this report presents  outcome of  committee  work over several years to secure   international convergence of supervisory regulations governing  capital adequacy of  international banks
 following  publication of  committee  proposals in december  1987
 a consultative process was set in train in all g-10 countries and  proposals were also  circulated to supervisory authorities worldwide
 as a result of those consultations some  changes were made to  original proposals
 the present paper is now a statement of   committee agreed by all its members
 it sets out  details of  agreed framework for  measuring capital adequacy and  minimum standard to be achieved which  national  supervisory authorities represented on  committee intend to implement in ir respective  countries
 the framework and this standard have been endorsed by  group of ten central- bank governors
  2
    with a view to implementation as soon as possible
 it is intended  national authorities   should now prepare papers setting out ir views on  timetable and  manner in which  this accord will be implemented in ir respective countries
 this document is being  circulated to supervisory authorities worldwide with a view to encouraging  adoption of  this framework in countries outside  g-10 in respect of banks conducting significant  international business
  3
    two fundamental objectives lie at  heart of  committee  work on regulatory   convergence
 these are
 firstly
   new framework should serve to strengn   soundness and stability of  international banking system
 and secondly   framework  should be in fair and have a high degree of consistency in its application to banks in different  countries with a view to diminishing an existing source of competitive inequality among  international banks
 the committee notes 
 in responding to  invitation to comment  on its original proposals
 banks have welcomed  general shape and rationale of   framework and have expressed support for  view  it should be applied as uniformly as  possible at  national level
  the basle committee on banking supervision comprises representatives of  central banks  and supervisory authorities of  group of ten countries

    throughout  recent consultations
 close contact has been maintained between   committee in basle and  authorities of  european community in brussels who are  pursuing a parallel initiative to develop a common solvency ratio to be applied to credit  institutions in  community
 the aim has been to ensure  maximum degree of  consistency between  framework agreed in basle and  framework to be applied in   community
 it is  committee  hope and expectation  this consistency can be achieved
  although it should be noted  regulations in  european community are designed to apply  to credit institutions generally
 whereas  committee  framework is directed more  specifically with banks undertaking international business in mind
  5
    in developing  framework described in this document  committee has sought to  arrive at a set of principles which are conceptually sound and at  same time pay due regard  to particular features of  present supervisory and accounting systems in individual member  countries
 it believes  this objective has been achieved
 the framework provides for a  transitional period so   existing circumstances in different countries can be reflected in  flexible arrangements  allow time for adjustment
  6
    in certain very limited respects 
notably as regards some of  risk weightings
    framework allows for a degree of national discretion in  way in which it is applied
 the  impact of such discrepancies on  overall ratios is likely to be negligible and it is not  considered  y will compromise  basic objectives
 neverless
  committee  intends to monitor and review  application of  framework in  period ahead with a  view to achieving even greater consistency
  7
    it should be stressed   agreed framework is designed to establish minimum levels  of capital for internationally active banks
 national authorities will be free to adopt  arrangements  set higher levels
  8
     it should also be emphasised  capital adequacy as measured by  present framework
   though important
 is one of a number of factors to be taken into account when assessing    strength of banks
 the framework in this document is mainly directed towards assessing  capital in relation to credit risk 
 risk of counterparty failure
 but or risks
 notably  interest rate risk and  investment risk on securities
 need to be taken into account by  supervisors in assessing overall capital adequacy
 the committee is examining possible  approaches in relation to se risks
 furrmore
 and more generally
 capital ratios
 judged  in isolation
 may provide a misleading guide to relative strength
 much also depends on   quality of a bank  assets and
 importantly
  level of provisions a bank may be holding  outside its capital against assets of doubtful value
 recognising  close relationship between  capital and provisions
  committee will continue to monitor provisioning policies by banks  in member countries and will seek to promote convergence of policies in this field as in or  regulatory matters
 in assessing progress by banks in member countries towards meeting   agreed capital standards
  committee will refore take careful account of any differences  in existing policies and procedures for setting  level of provisions among countries banks  and in  form in which such provisions are constituted
  9
     the committee is aware  differences between countries in  fiscal treatment and   accounting presentation for tax purposes of certain classes of provisions for losses and of  capital reserves derived from retained earnings may to some extent distort  comparability  of  real or apparent capital positions of international banks
 convergence in tax regimes
  though desirable
 lies outside  competence of  committee and tax considerations are  not addressed in this paper
 however
  committee wishes to keep se tax and accounting  matters under review to  extent  y affect  comparability of  capital adequacy  of different countries
banking systems
  10
    this agreement is intended to be applied to banks on a consolidated basis
 including   subsidiaries undertaking banking and financial business
 at  same time
  committee  recognises  ownership structures and  position of banks within financial conglomerate  groups are undergoing significant changes
 the committee will be concerned to ensure   ownership structures should not be such as to weaken  capital position of  bank or  expose it to risks stemming from or parts of  group
 the committee will continue to  keep se developments under review in  light of  particular regulations in member  countries
 in order to ensure   integrity of  capital of banks is maintained
 in   case of several of  subjects for furr work mentioned above
 notably investment risk and   consolidated supervision of financial groups
  european community has undertaken or  is undertaking work with similar objectives and close liaison will be maintained
  11
    this document is divided into four sections
 the first two describe  framework
 section  i  constituents of capital and section ii  risk weighting system
 section iii deals with    target standard ratio
 and section iv with transitional and implementing arrangements
    i
  the constituents of capital    
a
  core capital 
basic equity
  12
    the committee considers   key element of capital on which  main emphasis  should be placed is equity capital and disclosed reserves
 this key element of capital is   only element common to all countries banking systems
" it is wholly visible in  issued and fully paid ordinary shares/common stock and non-cumulative perpetual preferred  stock "
but excluding cumulative preferred stock
""
   published accounts and is  basis on which most market judgements of capital adequacy  are made
 and it has a crucial bearing on profit margins and a bank  ability to compete
 this  emphasis   on equity capital and disclosed reserves reflects  importance  committee attaches to  securing   a progressive enhancement in  quality
 as well as  level
 of  total capital resources   maintained by major banks
  13
    notwithstanding this emphasis
  member countries of  committee also consider   re are a number of or important and legitimate constituents of a bank  capital  base which may be included within  system of measurement 
subject to certain conditions  set out in sub-section 
b
 below
""
  14
    the committee has refore concluded  capital
 for supervisory purposes
 should  be defined in two tiers in a way which will have  effect of requiring at least 50% of a bank    capital base to consist of a core element comprised of equity capital and published reserves  from post-tax retained earnings 
tier 1
""
 the or elements of capital 
supplementary capital
  will be admitted into tier 2 up to an amount equal to  of  core capital
 these  supplementary capital elements and  particular conditions attaching to ir inclusion in   capital base are set out below and in more detail in annex 1
 each of se elements may  be included or not included by national authorities at ir discretion in  light of ir  national accounting and supervisory regulations
  
b
  supplementary capital  
i
  undisclosed reserves  15
    unpublished or hidden reserves may be constituted in various ways according to differing   legal and accounting regimes in member countries
 under this heading are included only  reserves which
 though unpublished
 have been passed through  profit and loss account  and which are accepted by  bank  supervisory authorities
 they may be inherently of   same intrinsic quality as published retained earnings
 but
 in  context of an internationally  agreed minimum standard
 ir lack of transparency
 toger with  fact  many  countries do not recognise undisclosed reserves
 eir as an accepted accounting concept or  as a legitimate element of capital
 argue for excluding m from  core equity capital  element
  
ii
  revaluation reserves  16
    some countries
 under ir national regulatory or accounting arrangements
 allow  certain assets to be revalued to reflect ir current value
 or something closer to ir current  one member country
 however
 maintains  view  an international definition of capital   should be confined to core capital elements and indicated  it would continue to press for   definition to be reconsidered by  committee in  years ahead
  value than historic cost
 and  resultant revaluation reserves to be included in  capital   base
 such revaluations can arise in two ways
  
a
  from a formal revaluation
 carried through to  balance sheets of banks own premises
  or  
b
  from a notional addition to capital of hidden values which arise from  practice of  holding   securities in  balance sheet valued at historic costs
  such reserves may be included within supplementary capital provided   assets are  considered by  supervisory authority to be prudently valued
 fully reflecting  possibility  of price fluctuations and forced sale
  17
    alternative 
b
 is relevant to those banks whose balance sheets traditionally include very   substantial amounts of equities held in ir portfolio at historic cost but which can be
 and  on occasions are
 realised at current prices and used to offset losses
" the committee considers  se ""latent"" revaluation reserves can be included among supplementary elements of capital  since y can be used to absorb losses on a going-concern basis"
 provided y are subject to  a substantial discount in order to reflect concerns both about market volatility and about   tax charge which would arise were such cases to be realised
 a discount of 55% on   difference between  historic cost book value and market value is agreed to be appropriate  in  light of se considerations
 the committee considered
 but rejected
  proposition   latent reserves arising in respect of  undervaluation of banks premises should also be  included within  definition of supplementary capital
  
iii
" general provisions/general loan-loss reserves  18"
     general provisions or general loan-loss reserves are created against  possibility of   future losses
 where y are not ascribed to particular assets and do not reflect a reduction  in  valuation of particular assets
 se reserves qualify for inclusion in capital and it has  been agreed  y should be counted within tier 2
 where
 however
 provisions have been  created against identified losses or in respect of a demonstrable deterioration in  value of  particular assets
 y are not freely available to meet unidentified losses which may  subsequently arise elsewhere in  portfolio and do not possess an essential characteristic of  capital
 such specific or earmarked provisions should refore not be included in  capital  base
  19
    the committee accepts
 however
 
 in practice
 it is not always possible to distinguish   clearly between general provisions 
or general loan-loss reserves
 which are genuinely freely   available and those provisions which in reality are earmarked against assets already identified  as impaired
 this partly reflects  present diversity of accounting
 supervisory
 and
  importantly
 fiscal policies in respect of provisioning and in respect of national definitions of  capital
 this means
 inevitably
  initially re will be a degree of inconsistency in   characteristics of general provisions or general loan-loss reserves included by different  member countries within  framework
  20
    in  light of se uncertainties
  committee intends during  transitional period   
see paragraphs 45 to 50 below
 to clarify  distinction made in member countries between  those elements which should conceptually be regarded as part of capital and those which  should not qualify
 the committee will aim to develop before  end of 1990 firm proposals  applicable to all member countries
 so as to ensure consistency in  definition of general  provisions and general loan-loss reserves eligible for inclusion in  capital base by  time   interim and final minimum target standards fall to be observed
  21
     as a furr safeguard
 in  event  agreement is not reached on  refined   definition of unencumbered resources eligible for inclusion in supplementary capital
 where  general provisions and general loan-loss reserves may include amounts reflecting lower  valuations for assets or latent but unidentified losses present in  balance sheet
  amount  of such reserves or provisions  qualify as capital would be phased down so 
 at  end  of  transitional period
 such items would constitute no more than 1
25 percentage points
  or exceptionally and temporarily up to 2
0 percentage points
 of risk assets within   secondary elements
  
iv
 hybrid debt capital instruments  22
    in this category fall a number of capital instruments which combine certain characteristics   of equity and certain characteristics of debt
 each of se has particular features which can  be considered to affect its quality as capital
 it has been agreed 
 where se instruments  have close similarities to equity
 in particular when y are able to support losses on an on- going basis without triggering liquidation
 y may be included in supplementary capital
 in  addition to perpetual preference shares carrying a cumulative fixed charge
  following  instruments
 for example
 may qualify for inclusion
 long-term preferred shares in canada
  titres participatifs and titres subordonns  dure indtermine in france
 genussscheine in  germany
 perpetual debt instruments in  united kingdom and mandatory convertible debt  instruments in  united states
   the qualifying criteria for such instruments are set out in annex 1
  
v
  subordinated term debt  23
    the committee is agreed  subordinated term debt instruments have significant   deficiencies as constituents of capital in view of ir fixed maturity and inability to absorb   losses except in a liquidation
 these deficiencies justify an additional restriction on  amount   of such debt capital which is eligible for inclusion within  capital base
 consequently
 it has   been concluded  subordinated term debt instruments with a minimum original term to  maturity of over five years may be included within  supplementary elements of capital
 but  only to a maximum of 50% of  core capital element and subject to adequate amortisation  arrangements
  
c
  deductions from capital  24
    it has been concluded   following deductions should be made from  capital  base for  purpose of calculating  risk-weighted capital ratio
 the deductions will consist  of
  
i
  goodwill
 as a deduction from tier 1 capital elements
  
ii
  investments in subsidiaries engaged in banking and financial activities which are not   consolidated in national systems
 the normal practice will be to consolidate subsidiaries for   purpose of assessing  capital adequacy of banking groups
 where this is not done
  deduction is essential to prevent  multiple use of  same capital resources in different  parts of  group
 the deduction for such investments will be made against  total capital  base
 the assets representing  investments in subsidiary companies whose capital had  been deducted from  of  parent would not be included in total assets for  purposes  of computing  ratio
  25
    the committee carefully considered  possibility of requiring deduction of banks  holdings of capital issued by or banks or deposit-taking institutions
 wher in  form  of equity or of or capital instruments
 several g-10 supervisory authorities currently  require such a deduction to be made in order to discourage  banking system as a whole  from creating cross-holdings of capital
 rar than drawing capital from outside investors
  the committee is very conscious  such double-gearing 
"or ""double-leveraging"""
 can have  systemic dangers for  banking system by making it more vulnerable to  rapid  transmission of problems from one institution to anor and some members consider se  dangers justify a policy of full deduction of such holdings
  26
    despite se concerns
 however
  committee as a whole is not presently in favour  of a general policy of deducting all holdings of or banks
capital
 on  grounds  to do  so could impede certain significant and desirable changes taking place in  structure of  domestic banking systems
  27
    the committee has noneless agreed 
  
a
  individual supervisory authorities should be free at ir discretion to apply a policy of   deduction
 eir for all holdings of or banks
capital
 or for holdings which exceed material   limits in relation to  holding bank  capital or  issuing bank  capital
 or on a   case-by-case basis
  
b
  where no deduction is applied
 banks holdings of or banks
capital instruments will  bear a weight of 100%
  
c
  in applying se policies
 member countries consider  reciprocal cross
holdings of  bank capital designed artificially to inflate  capital position of  banks concerned should  not be permitted
  
d
   committee will closely monitor  degree of double-gearing in  international  banking system and does not preclude  possibility of introducing constraints at a later date
  for this purpose
 supervisory authorities intend to ensure  adequate statistics are made  available to enable m and  committee to monitor  development of banks holdings  of or banks
equity and debt instruments which rank as capital under  present  agreement
    ii
  the risk weights  28
    the committee considers  a weighted risk ratio in which capital is related to different   categories of asset or off-balance-sheet exposure
 weighted according to broad categories of   relative riskiness
 is  preferred method for assessing  capital adequacy of banks
 this is   not to say  or methods of capital measurement are not also useful
 but y are  considered   by  committee to be supplementary to  risk-weight approach
 the committee believes   a   risk ratio has  following advantages over  simpler gearing ratio approach
  
i
  it provides a fairer basis for making international comparisons between banking systems  whose structures may differ
  
ii
  it allows off-balance-sheet exposures to be incorporated more easily into  measure
  
iii
 it does not deter banks from holding liquid or or assets which carry low risk
  29
    the framework of weights has been kept as simple as possible and only five weights are  used 
0
 10
 20
 50 and 100%
 there are inevitably some broad-brush judgements in deciding  which weight should apply to different types of asset and  weightings should not be  regarded as a substitute for commercial judgement for purposes of market pricing of   different instruments
  30
    the weighting structure is set out in detail in annexes 2 and 3
 there are six aspects of    structure to which attention is particularly drawn
  
i
  categories of risk captured in  framework  31
    there are many different kinds of risks against which banks managements need to guard
  for most banks  major risk is credit risk
  is to say  risk of counterparty failure
 but  re are many or kinds of risk 
for example
 investment risk
 interest rate risk
 exchange  rate risk
 concentration risk
 the central focus of this framework is credit risk and
 as a furr  aspect of credit risk
 country transfer risk
 in addition
 individual supervisory authorities have  discretion to build in certain or types of risk
 some countries
 for example
 will wish to  retain a weighting for open foreign exchange positions or for some aspects of investment risk
  no standardisation has been attempted in  treatment of se or kinds of risk in   framework at  present stage
  32
    the committee considered  desirability of seeking to incorporate additional  weightings to reflect  investment risk in holdings of fixed rate government securities 
one  manifestation of interest rate risk which is of course present across  whole range of a bank   activities
 on and off  balance sheet
 for  present
 it was concluded  individual  supervisory authorities should be free to apply eir a zero or a low weight to claims on  governments 
""
 10% for all securities or 10% for those maturing in under one year and 20%  for one year and over
""
 all members agreed
 however
  interest rate risk generally required  furr study and  if
 in due course
 furr work made it possible to develop a satisfactory  method of measurement for this aspect of risk for  business as a whole
 consideration  should be given to applying some appropriate control alongside this credit risk framework
  work is already under way to explore  possibilities in this regard
  
ii
  country transfer risk  33
    in addressing country transfer risk
  committee has been very conscious of   difficulty of devising a satisfactory method for incorporating country transfer risk into   framework of measurement
 in its earlier
 consultative
 paper two alternative approaches  were put forward for consideration and comment
 these were
 firstly
 a simple differentiation  between claims on domestic institutions 
central government
 official sector and banks
 and  claims on all foreign countries
 and secondly
 differentiation on  basis of an approach  involving  selection of a defined grouping of countries considered to be of high credit  standing
  34
     the comments submitted to  committee by banks and banking associations in g-10  countries during  consultative period were overwhelmingly in favour of  second  alternative
 in support of this view
 three particular arguments were strongly represented to   committee
 firstly
" it was stressed  a simple domestic/foreign split effectively ignores   reality  transfer risk varies greatly between different countries and  this risk is of  sufficient significance to make it necessary to ensure  broad distinctions in  credit  standing of industrialised and non-industrialised countries should be made and captured in   system of measurement"
 particularly one designed for international banks
 secondly
" it  was argued   domestic/foreign split does not reflect  global integration of financial  markets and  absence of some furr refinement would discourage international banks  from holding securities issued by central governments of major foreign countries as liquid  cover against ir euro-currency liabilities"
" to  extent a domestic/foreign approach would  run counter to an important objective of  risk weighting framework"
 namely  it should  encourage prudent liquidity management
 thirdly
 and most importantly
  member states  of  european community are firmly committed to  principle  all claims on banks
  central governments and  official sector within european community countries should be  treated in  same way
 this means 
 where such a principle is put into effect
" re would  be an undesirable asymmetry in  manner in which a domestic/foreign split was applied by   seven g-10 countries which are members of  community compared with  manner  in which it was applied by  non-community countries"
  35
     in  light of se arguments
  committee has concluded  a defined group of   countries should be adopted as  basis for applying differential weighting coefficients
 and   this group should be full members of  oecd or countries which have concluded special  lending arrangements with  imf associated with  fund  general arrangements to  borrow
 this group of countries is referred to as  oecd in  rest of  report
  36
     this decision has  following consequences for  weighting structure
 claims on  central governments within  oecd will attract a zero weight 
or a low weight if  national  supervisory authority elects to incorporate interest rate risk
""
 and claims on oecd non-central  government public-sector entities will attract a low weight 
see 
iii
 below
""
 claims on central  governments and central banks outside  oecd will also attract a zero weight 
or a low  weight if  national supervisory authority elects to incorporate interest rate risk
""
 provided  such claims are denominated in  national currency and funded by liabilities in  same  currency
 this reflects  absence of risks relating to  availability and transfer of foreign  exchange on such claims
  37
    as regards  treatment of interbank claims
 in order to preserve  efficiency and   liquidity of  international interbank market re will be no differentiation between short- term claims on banks incorporated within or outside  oecd
 however
  committee  draws a distinction between
 on  one hand
 short-term placements with or banks which  is an accepted method of managing liquidity in  interbank market and carries a perception  of low risk and
 on  or
" longer-term cross-border loans to banks which are often  associated with particular transactions and carry greater transfer and/or credit risks"
 a 20%  weight will refore be applied to claims on all banks
 wherever incorporated
 with a residual  maturity of up to and including one year
 longer-term claims on oecd incorporated banks will  be weighted at 20%
 and longer-term claims on banks incorporated outside  oecd will be  weighted at 100%
  
iii
 claims on non-central-government
 public-sector entities 
pses
  38
    the committee concluded  it was not possible to settle on a single common weight   can be applied to all claims on domestic public-sector entities below  level of central   government 
""
 states
 local authorities
 etc
""
 in view of  special character and varying  creditworthiness of se entities in different member countries
 the committee refore  opted to   allow discretion to each national supervisory authority to determine  appropriate  weighting factors for  pses within  country
 in order to preserve a degree of  convergence in  application of such discretion
  committee agreed   weights  ascribed in this way should be 0
 10
 20 or 50% for domestic pses
 but  pses in foreign  countries within  oecd should attract a standard 20% weight
 these arrangements will be  subject to review by  committee in pursuit of furr convergence towards common  weights and consistent definitions in member countries and in  light of decisions to be  taken within  european community on  specification of a common solvency ratio for  credit institutions
 commercial companies owned by  public sector will attract a uniform  weight of 100% inter alia in order to avoid competitive inequality vis--vis similar private- sector commercial enterprises
  
iv
 collateral and guarantees  39
     the framework recognises  importance of collateral in reducing credit risk
 but only  to a limited extent
 in view of  varying practices among banks in different countries for  taking collateral and different experiences of  stability of physical or financial collateral  values
 it has not been found possible to develop a basis for recognising collateral generally in   weighting system
 the more limited recognition of collateral will apply only to loans  secured against cash or against securities issued by oecd central governments and specified  multilateral development banks
 these will attract  weight given to  collateral 
i
e
 a  zero or low weight
""
 loans partially collateralised by se assets will also attract   equivalent low weights on  part of  loan which is fully collateralised
  40
    as regards loans or or exposures guaranteed by third parties
  committee has  agreed  loans guaranteed by oecd central governments
 oecd public-sector entities
 or  oecd incorporated banks will attract  weight allocated to a direct claim on  guarantor  
""
 20% in  case of banks
""
 loans guaranteed by non-oecd incorporated banks will also  be recognised by  application of a 20% weight
 but only where  underlying transaction  has a residual maturity not exceeding one year
 the committee intends to monitor   application of this latter arrangement to ensure  it does not give rise to inappropriate  weighting of commercial loans
 in  case of loans covered by partial guarantees
 only   part of  loan which is covered by  guarantee will attract  reduced weight
 the  contingent liability assumed by banks in respect of guarantees will attract a credit conversion  factor of 100% 
see sub-section 
vi
 below
""
  
v
  loans secured on residential property  41
     loans fully secured by mortgage on occupied residential property have a very low record  of loss in most countries
 the framework will recognise this by assigning a 50% weight to loans  fully secured by mortgage on residential property which is rented or is 
or is intended to be
  occupied by  borrower
 in applying  50% weight
  supervisory authorities will satisfy  mselves
 according to ir national arrangements for  provision of housing finance
   this concessionary weight is applied restrictively for residential purposes and in  accordance with strict prudential criteria
 this may mean
 for example
  in some member  countries  50% weight will only apply to first mortgages
 creating a first charge on   property
 and  in or member countries it will only be applied where strict
 legally-based
  valuation rules ensure a substantial margin of additional security over  amount of  loan
  the 50% weight will specifically not be applied to loans to companies engaged in speculative  residential building or property development
 or collateral will not be regarded as  justifying  reduction of  weightings  would orwise apply
  
vi
 off-balance-sheet engagements  42
     the committee believes  it is of great importance  all off-balance-sheet activity   should be caught within  capital adequacy framework
 at  same time
 it is recognised   re is only limited experience in assessing  risks in some of  activities
 also   for some countries
 a complex analytical approach and detailed and frequent reporting  systems cannot easily be justified when  amounts of such business
 particularly in   newer
 more innovative instruments
 are only small
 the approach  has been agreed
  which is on  same lines as  described in  committee  report on  supervisory  treatment of off-balance-sheet exposures issued to banks in march 1986
 is comprehensive in   all categories of off-balance-sheet engagements
 including recent innovations
 will be  converted to credit risk equivalents by multiplying  nominal principal amounts by a credit  conversion factor
  resulting amounts n being weighted according to  nature of   counterparty
 the different instruments and techniques are divided into five broad categories  
within which member countries will have some limited discretion to allocate particular  instruments according to ir individual characteristics   in national markets
""
        one member country feels strongly   lower weight should also apply to or loans  secured by mortgages on domestic property
 provided   amount of  loan does not  exceed 60% of  value of  property as calculated according to strict legal valuation criteria
  
a
  those which substitute for loans 
""
 general guarantees of indebtedness
 bank  acceptance guarantees and standby letters of credit serving as financial guarantees for loans  and securities
   
se will carry a 100% credit risk conversion factor
  
b
  certain transaction-related contingencies 
""
 performance bonds
 bid bonds
 warranties  and standby letters of credit related to particular transactions
 
a 50% credit risk conversion   factor
  
c
  short-term
 self-liquidating trade-related contingent liabilities arising from  movement  of goods 
""
 documentary credits collateralised by  underlying shipments
 
a 20% credit  risk conversion factor
  
d
  commitments with an original maturity exceeding one year 
 longer maturity serving  broadly as a proxy for higher risk facilities
 and all nifs and rufs 
a 50% credit risk conversion  factor
   shorter-term commitments or commitments which can be unconditionally cancelled at any  time
 it is agreed
 generally carry only low risk and a nil weight for se is considered to be  justified on de minimis grounds
  
e
  interest and exchange rate related items 
""
 swaps
 options
 futures
 
 credit risk  equivalent amount for se contracts will be calculated in one of two ways 
see below and  annex   3
""
  43
    special treatment is needed for  items in 
e
 above because banks are not exposed to   credit risk for  full face value of ir contracts
 but only to  cost of replacing  cash  flow if a counterparty defaults
 most members of  committee accept   correct  method of assessing  credit risk on se items is to calculate  current replacement cost  by marking to   market and to add a factor to represent potential exposure during  remaining life of    contract
 some member countries
 however
 are concerned about  consistency of this  method in relation to  rest of  system which only makes broad distinctions between  relative risks for on-balance-sheet items
 particularly for banks where se off-balance-sheet  items currently constitute only a very small part of  total risks
 they would prefer to apply  an alternative approach consisting of conversion factors based on  nominal principal sum  underlying each contract according to its type and maturity
 the committee has concluded   members will be allowed to choose eir of  two methods
 the details of  two  alternative methods are set out in annex 3
          in order to facilitate date collection
 during  transitional period up to end-1992
 but not  beyond
 national supervisory authorities will have discretion to apply residual maturity as a  basis for measuring commitments
        iii
 a target standard ratio  44
    in  light of consultations and preliminary testing of  framework
  committee is   agreed  a minimum standard should be set now which international banks generally will  be expected to achieve by  end of  transitional period
 it is also agreed  this standard   should be set at a level  is consistent with  objective of securing over time soundly- based and consistent capital ratios for all international banks
 accordingly
  committee  confirms   target standard ratio of capital to weighted risk assets should be set at 8%  
of which  core capital element will be at least 4%
""
 this is expressed as a common  minimum standard which international banks in member countries will be expected to  observe by  end of 1992
 thus allowing a transitional period of some four-and-a-half years  for any necessary adjustment by banks who need time to build up to those levels
 the   committee fully recognises   transition from existing
 sometimes long-established
  definitions of capital and methods of measurement towards a new internationally agreed  standard will not necessarily be achieved easily or quickly
 the full   period to end-1992 is available to ensure progressive steps towards adjustment and banks  whose ratios are presently below  8% standard will not be required to take immediate or  precipitate action
    iv
 transitional and implementing arrangements    
i
  transition  45
    certain transitional arrangements have been agreed upon to ensure  re are  sustained efforts during  transitional period to build up individual banks ratios towards   ultimate target standard
 and to facilitate smooth adjustment and phasing in of  new  arrangements within a wide variety of existing supervisory systems
  46
    the transitional period will be from  date of this paper to  end of 1992
 by which   latter date all banks undertaking significant cross-border business will be expected to meet   standard in full 
see paragraph 50 below
""
 in addition
 re will be an interim standard to  be met by  end of 1990 
see paragraph 49 below
""
  47
    initially no formal standard or minimum level will be set
 it is  general view of    committee
 however
  every encouragement should be given to those banks whose  capital levels are at  low end of  range to build up ir capital as quickly as possible and   committee expects re to be no erosion of existing capital standards in individual  member countries
banks
 thus
 during  transitional period
 all banks which need to  improve capital levels up to  interim and final standards should not diminish even  temporarily ir current capital levels 
subject to  fluctuations which can occur around   time new capital is raised
""
 a level of 5% attained by application of  framework and  transitional arrangements is considered by some countries to be a reasonable yardstick for   lower capitalised banks to seek to attain in  short term
 individual member countries  will
 of course
 be free to set
 and announce
 at  outset of  transitional period  level  from which y would expect all ir banks to move towards  interim and final target  standard
 in order to assess and compare progress during  initial period of adjustment to  end-1990 in a manner which takes account both of existing supervisory systems and  new  arrangements
  committee and individual supervisory authorities will initially apply   basis of measurement set out in paragraph 48 below
  48
    in measuring  capital position of banks at  start of  transitional period
 a   proportion of  core capital may be made up of supplementary elements up to a maximum  of 25% of core capital elements
 reducing to 10% by end-1990
 in addition
 throughout   transitional period up to end-1992
 subject to more restrictive policies which individual  authorities may wish to apply
 term subordinated debt may be included without limit as a  constituent of supplementary elements and  deduction from tier 1 capital elements in  respect of goodwill may be waived
  49
    at end-1990 re will be an interim minimum standard of 7
25% of which at least half  should be core capital
 however
 between end-1990 and end-1992 up to 10% of  required  core elements may be made up of supplementary elements
 this means
 in round figures
 a  minimum core capital element of 3
6%
 of which tier 1 elements should total at least 3
25%
  is to be achieved by  end of 1990
 in addition
 from end-1990
 general loan-loss reserves  or general provisions which include amounts reflecting lower valuations of assets or latent but  unidentified losses present in  balance sheet will be limited to 1
5 percentage points
 or  exceptionally up to 2
0 percentage points
 of risk assets within supplementary elements
  50
     at end-1992  transitional period ends
 the minimum standard will n be 8%
 of  which core capital 
tier 1
 equity and reserves
 will be at least 4%
 supplementary elements no  more than core capital and term subordinated debt within supplementary elements no more  than 50% of tier 1
 in addition
 general loan-loss reserves or general provisions 
having   characteristics described in paragraph 49
 will be limited at end-1992 to 1
25 percentage  points
 or exceptionally and temporarily up to 2
06 percentage points
 within supplementary  elements
 for ease of reference
  arrangements described in paragraphs 45 to 50 are  summarised in a table at annex 4
  these limits would only apply in  event  no agreement is reached on a consistent basis   for including unencumbered provisions or reserves in capital 
see paragraphs 20 and 21
""
      
ii
  implementation  51
     the arrangements described in this document will be implemented at national level at   earliest possible opportunity
 each country will decide  way in which  supervisory   authorities will introduce and apply se recommendations in  light of ir different legal   structures and existing supervisory arrangements
 in some countries
 changes in  capital  regime may be introduced
 after consultation
 relatively speedily without  need for  legislation
 or countries may employ more lengthy procedures
 and in some cases se  may require legislation
 in due course  member states of  european community will also  need to ensure  ir own domestic regulations are compatible with  community  own  legislative proposals in this field
   none of se factors needs result in any inconsistency in  timing of implementation among   member countries
 for example
 some countries may apply  framework in this report
  formally or informally
 in parallel with ir existing system
 certainly during  initial period  of transition
 in this way banks can be assisted to start  necessary process of adjustment in  good time before substantive changes in national systems are formally introduced

ii
  tier 2
 
a
 undisclosed reserves are eligible for inclusion within supplementary elements   provided se reserves are accepted by  supervisor
 such reserves consist of  part of   accumulated after-tax surplus of retained profits which banks in some countries may be  permitted to maintain as an undisclosed reserve
 apart from  fact   reserve is not  identified in  published balance sheet
 it should have  same high quality and character  as a disclosed capital reserve
   as such
 it should not be encumbered by any provision or or known liability but should be   freely and immediately available to meet unforeseen future losses
 this definition of  undisclosed reserves excludes hidden values arising from holdings of securities in  balance  sheet at below current market prices 
see below
""
  
b
 revaluation reserves arise in two ways
 firstly
 in some countries
 banks 
and or  commercial companies
 are permitted to revalue fixed assets
 normally ir own premises
  from time to time in line with  change in market values
 in some of se countries   amount of such revaluations is determined by law
 revaluations of this kind are reflected on   face of  balance sheet as a revaluation reserve
        including
 at national discretion
 allocations to or from reserve during  course of  year   from current year  retained profit
    secondly
" hidden values of ""latent"" revaluation reserves may be present as a result of long- term holdings of equity securities valued in  balance sheet at  historic cost of acquisition"
  both types of revaluation reserve may be included in tier 2 provided   assets are  prudently valued
 fully reflecting  possibility of price fluctuation and forced sale
" in  case  of ""latent"" revaluation reserves a discount of 55% will be applied to  difference between  historic cost book value and market value to reflect  potential volatility of this form of  unrealised capital and  notional tax charge on it"
  
c
" general provisions/general loan-loss reserves"
 provisions or loan-loss reserves held against  future
 presently unidentified losses are freely available to meet losses which subsequently  materialise and refore qualify for inclusion within supplementary elements
 provisions  ascribed to impairment of particular assets or known liabilities should be excluded

    foreign exchange and interest rate related contingencies  the treatment of foreign exchange and interest rate related items needs special attention  because banks are not exposed to credit risk for  full face value of ir contracts
 but only  to  potential cost of replacing  cash flow 
on contracts showing positive value
 if   counterparty defaults
 the credit equivalent amounts will depend inter alia on  maturity of   contract and on  volatility of  rates underlying  type of instrument
despite   wide range of different instruments in  market
  oretical basis for assessing  credit  risk on all of m has been  same
 it has consisted of an analysis of  behaviour of  matched pairs of swaps under different volatility assumptions
   since exchange rate contracts involve an exchange of principal on maturity
 as well as being   generally more volatile
 higher conversion factors are proposed for those instruments which  feature exchange rate risk
 interest rate contracts are defined to include single-currency  interest rate swaps
 basis swaps
 forward rate agreements
 interest rate futures
 interest rate  options purchased and similar instruments
 exchange rate contracts include cross-currency  interest rate swaps
 forward foreign exchange contracts
 currency futures
 currency options  purchased and similar instruments
 exchange rate contracts with an original maturity of  fourteen calendar days or less are excluded
      these items are to be weighted according to  type of asset and not according to  type  of counterparty with whom  transaction has been entered into
 reverse repos 
i
e
  purchase and resale agreement 
where  bank is  receiver of  asset
 are to be treated  as collateralised loans
 reflecting  economic reality of  transaction
 the risk is refore  to be measured as an exposure on  counterparty
 where  asset temporarily acquired is  a security which attracts a preferential risk weighting
 this would be recognised as collateral  and  risk weighting would be reduced accordingly
            a majority of g-10 supervisory authorities are of  view   best way to assess  credit  risk on se items is to ask banks to calculate  current replacement cost by marketing  contracts to market
 thus capturing  current exposure without any need for estimation
  and n adding a factor 
" ""add-on"""
 to reflect  potential future exposure over   remaining life of  contract
 it has been agreed 
 in order to calculate  credit  equivalent amount of its off-balance-sheet interest rate and foreign exchange rate  instruments under this current exposure method
 a bank would sum
  
 total replacement cost 
"obtained by ""marking to market"""
 of all its contracts with positive  value
 and  
an amount for potential future credit exposure calculated on  basis of    total notional principal amount of its book
 split by residual maturity as follows
    residual maturity          less than one year   one year and over   interest rate contracts       nil       0
5%   exchange rate contracts     1
0%       5
"0%        no potential credit exposure would be calculated for single currency floating/floating interest  rate swaps"
  credit exposure on se contracts would be evaluated solely on  basis of  ir mark-to-market value
 a few g-10 supervisors believe  this two-step approach
"  incorporating a ""mark-to-market"" element"
 is not consistent with  remainder of  capital  framework
 they favour a simpler method whereby  potential credit exposure is estimated  against each type of contract and a notional capital weight allotted
 no matter what   market value of  contract might be at a particular reporting date
 it has refore been  agreed supervisory authorities should have discretion to apply  alternative method of  calculation described below
 in which credit conversion factors are derived without reference  to  current market price of  instruments
 in deciding on what those notional credit  conversion factors should be
 it has been agreed  a slightly more cautious bias is justified  since  current exposure is not being calculated on a regular basis
      instruments traded on exchanges may be excluded where y are subject to daily margining   requirements
 options purchased over  counter are included with  same conversion  factors as or instruments
 but this decision might be reviewed in  light of future  experience
          in order to arrive at  credit equivalent amount using this original exposure method
 a bank  would simply apply one of  following two sets of conversion factors to  notional principal  amounts of each instrument according to  nature of  instrument and its maturity
    maturity    less than one year  one year and less than two years  for each additional year  interest rate contracts  0

  careful consideration has been given to  arguments put forward  for recognising netting
  i
e
 for weighting  net rar than  gross claims arising out of swaps and similar contracts  with  same counterparties
   the criterion on which a decision has been based is  status of a netting contract under  national bankruptcy regulations
 if a liquidator of a failed counterparty has 
or may have
   right to unbundle  netting contracts
 demanding performance on those contracts  favourable to his client and defaulting on unfavourable contracts
 re is no reduction in  counterparty risk
  accordingly
 it has been agreed 
  
banks may net contracts subject to novation
 since it appears  counterparty risk is  genuinely reduced by  substitution of a novated contract which legally extinguishes   previous obligation
 however
 since under some national bankruptcy laws liquidators may  have  right to unbundle transactions undertaken within a given period under a charge of  fraudulent preference
 supervisory authorities will have national discretion to require a phase- in period before a novation agreement can be recognised in  weighting framework
  
banks may not for  time being net contracts subject to close-out clauses
   the effectiveness of such agreements in an insolvency has not yet been tested in  courts
  nor has it been possible to obtain satisfactory legal opinion  liquidators would not be able  to overturn m
 however
  committee does not wish to discourage market participants  from employing clauses which might well afford protection in certain circumstances in some  national jurisdictions and would be prepared to reverse its conclusion if subsequent decisions  in  courts support  integrity of close-out netting agreements
 in any event
   committee will continue its work to assess  acceptability of various forms of netting
    some national authorities may permit individual banks to choose which method to adopt
 it  being understood  once a bank had chosen to apply  current exposure method
 it would  not be allowed to switch back to  original exposure method
    for interest rate contracts
 re is national discretion as to wher  conversion factors  are to be based on original or residual maturity
 for exchange rate contracts
  conversion   factors are to be calculated according to  original maturity of  instrument
    netting by novation as defined in this context is a bilateral contract between two  counterparties under which any obligation to each or to deliver a given currency on a given  date is automatically amalgamated with all or obligations for  same currency and value  date
 legally substituting one single net amount for  previous gross obligations
    close-out as defined in this context refers to a bilateral contract which provides 
 if one of   counterparties is wound up
  outstanding obligations between  two are accelerated   and netted to determine  counterparty  net exposure
    the or principal form of netting
 payments netting
 which is designed to reduce   counterparty risk arising out of daily settlements
 will not be recognised in  capital  framework since  counterparty  gross obligations are not in any way affected
    some member countries reserve  right to apply  full 100% weight
              once  bank has calculated  credit equivalent amounts
 wher according to  current  or  original exposure method
 y are to be weighted according to  category of  counterparty in  same way as in  main framework
 including concessionary weighting in  respect of exposures backed by eligible guarantees and collateral
 in addition
 since most  counterparties in se markets
 particularly for long-term contracts
 tend to be first-class  names
 it has been agreed  a 50% weight will be applied in respect of counterparties which  would orwise attract a 100% weight
    however
  committee will keep a close eye on  credit quality of participants in se  markets and reserves  right to raise  weights if average credit quality deteriorates or if  loss experience increases
