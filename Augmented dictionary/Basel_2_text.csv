  a revised framework      introduction      1
        this report presents  outcome of  basel committee on banking supervisions  
 committee
 work over recent years to secure international convergence on revisions  to supervisory regulations governing  capital adequacy of internationally active banks
  following  publication of  committees first round of proposals for revising  capital  adequacy framework in june 1999
 an extensive consultative process was set in train in all  member countries and  proposals were also circulated to supervisory authorities  worldwide
 the committee subsequently released additional proposals for consultation in  january 2001 and april 2003 and furrmore conducted three quantitative impact studies  related to its proposals
 as a result of se efforts
 many valuable improvements have been  made to  original proposals
 the present paper is now a statement of  committee  agreed by all its members
 it sets out  details of  agreed framework for measuring  capital adequacy and  minimum standard to be achieved which  national supervisory  authorities represented on  committee will propose for adoption in ir respective  countries
 this framework and  standard it contains have been endorsed by  central  bank governors and heads of banking supervision of  group of ten countries
    2
       the committee expects its members to move forward with  appropriate adoption  procedures in ir respective countries
 in a number of instances
 se procedures will  include additional impact assessments of  committees framework as well as furr  opportunities for comments by interested parties to be provided to national authorities
 the  committee intends  framework set out here to be available for implementation as of year
 end 2006
 however
  committee feels  one furr year of impact studies or parallel  calculations will be needed for  most advanced approaches
 and se refore will be  available for implementation as of year-end 2007
 more details on  transition to   revised framework and its relevance to particular approaches are set out in paragraphs 45  to 49
    3
       this document is being circulated to supervisory authorities worldwide with a view to  encouraging m to consider adopting this revised framework at such time as y believe  is consistent with ir broader supervisory priorities
 while  revised framework has been  designed to provide options for banks and banking systems worldwide
  committee  acknowledges  moving toward its adoption in  near future may not be a first priority  forall non-g10 supervisory authorities in terms of what is needed to strengn ir  supervision
 where this is  case
 each national supervisor should consider carefully   benefits of  revised framework in  context of its domestic banking system when  developing a timetable and approach to implementation
            the basel committee on banking supervision is a committee of banking supervisory  authorities  was established by  central bank governors of  group of ten countries  in 1975
 it consists of senior representatives of bank supervisory authorities and central banks  from belgium
 canada
 france
 germany
 italy
 japan
 luxembourg
  nerlands
 spain
  sweden
 switzerland
  united kingdom
 and  united states
 it usually meets at  bank  for international settlements in basel
 where its permanent secretariat is located
  4
        the fundamental objective of  committees work to revise  1988 accord has  been to develop a framework  would furr strengn  soundness and stability of   international banking system while maintaining sufficient consistency  capital  adequacy regulation will not be a significant source of competitive inequality among  internationally active banks
 the committee believes   revised framework will  promote  adoption of stronger risk management practices by  banking industry
 and  views this as one of its major benefits
 the committee notes 
 in ir comments on   proposals
 banks and or interested parties have welcomed  concept and rationale of   three pillars 
minimum capital requirements
 supervisory review
 and market discipline
  approach on which  revised framework is based
 more generally
 y have expressed  support for improving capital regulation to take into account changes in banking and risk  management practices while at  same time preserving  benefits of a framework   can be applied as uniformly as possible at  national level
    5
        in developing  revised framework
  committee has sought to arrive at  significantly more risk-sensitive capital requirements  are conceptually sound and at   same time pay due regard to particular features of  present supervisory and accounting  systems in individual member countries
 it believes  this objective has been achieved
  the committee is also retaining key elements of  1988 capital adequacy framework
  including  general requirement for banks to hold total capital equivalent to at least 8% of  ir risk-weighted assets
  basic structure of  1996 market risk amendment regarding   treatment of market risk
 and  definition of eligible capital
    6
       a significant innovation of  revised framework is  greater use of assessments  of risk provided by banks internal systems as inputs to capital calculations
 in taking this  step
  committee is also putting forward a detailed set of minimum requirements designed  to ensure  integrity of se internal risk assessments
 it is not  committees intention  to dictate  form or operational detail of banks risk management policies and practices
  each supervisor will develop a set of review procedures for ensuring  banks systems and  controls are adequate to serve as  basis for  capital calculations
 supervisors will need  to exercise sound judgements when determining a banks state of readiness
 particularly  during  implementation process
 the committee expects national supervisors will focus  on compliance with  minimum requirements as a means of ensuring  overall integrity  of a banks ability to provide prudential inputs to  capital calculations and not as an end in  itself
    7
        the revised framework provides a range of options for determining  capital  requirements for credit risk and operational risk to allow banks and supervisors to select  approaches  are most appropriate for ir operations and ir financial market  infrastructure
 in addition
  framework also allows for a limited degree of national  discretion in  way in which each of se options may be applied
 to adapt  standards  to different conditions of national markets
 these features
 however
 will necessitate  substantial efforts by national authorities to ensure sufficient consistency in application
 the  committee intends to monitor and review  application of  framework in  period  ahead with a view to achieving even greater consistency
 in particular
 its accord  implementation group 
aig
 was established to promote consistency in  frameworks  application by encouraging supervisors to exchange information on implementation  approaches
       international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards
 basel  committeeon banking supervision 
july 1988
""
 as amended
  8
        the committee has also recognised  home country supervisors have an  important role in leading  enhanced cooperation between home and host country  supervisors  will be required for effective implementation
 the aig is developing practical  arrangements for cooperation and coordination  reduce implementation burden on banks  and conserve supervisory resources
 based on  work of  aig
 and based on its  interactions with supervisors and  industry
  committee has issued general principles  for  cross-border implementation of  revised framework and more focused principles  for  recognition of operational risk capital charges under advanced measurement  approaches for home and host supervisors
    9
        it should be stressed   revised framework is designed to establish minimum  levels of capital for internationally active banks
 as under  1988 accord
 national  authorities will be free to adopt arrangements  set higher levels of minimum capital
  moreover
 y are free to put in place supplementary measures of capital adequacy for   banking organisations y charter
 national authorities may use a supplementary capital  measure as a way to address
 for example
  potential uncertainties in  accuracy of   measure of risk exposures inherent in any capital rule or to constrain  extent to which an  organisation may fund itself with debt
 where a jurisdiction employs a supplementary capital  measure 
such as a leverage ratio or a large exposure limit
 in conjunction with  measure  set forth in this framework
 in some instances  capital required under  supplementary  measure may be more binding
 more generally
 under  second pillar
 supervisors should  expect banks to operate above minimum regulatory capital levels
    10
       the revised framework is more risk sensitive than  1988 accord
 but countries  where risks in  local banking market are relatively high noneless need to consider if  banks should be required to hold additional capital over and above  basel minimum
 this  is particularly  case with  more broad brush standardised approach
 but
 even in   case of  internal ratings-based 
irb
 approach
  risk of major loss events may be  higher than allowed for in this framework
    11
      the committee also wishes to highlight  need for banks and supervisors to give  appropriate attention to  second 
supervisory review
 and third 
market discipline
 pillars  of  revised framework
 it is critical   minimum capital requirements of  first pillar  be accompanied by a robust implementation of  second
 including efforts by banks to  assess ir capital adequacy and by supervisors to review such assessments
 in addition
   disclosures provided under  third pillar of this framework will be essential in ensuring   market discipline is an effective complement to  or two pillars
    12
      the committee is aware  interactions between regulatory and accounting  approaches at both  national and international level can have significant consequences  for  comparability of  resulting measures of capital adequacy and for  costs  associated with  implementation of se approaches
 the committee believes  its  decisions with respect to unexpected and expected losses represent a major step forward in  this regard
 the committee and its members intend to continue playing a pro-active role in   dialogue with accounting authorities in an effort to reduce
 wherever possible
  inappropriate disparities between regulatory and accounting standards
    13
      the revised framework presented here reflects several significant changes relative  to  committees most recent consultative proposal in april 2003
 a number of se  changes have already been described in  committees press statements of october 2003
  january 2004 and may 2004
 these include  changes in  approach to  treatment of  expected losses 
el
 and unexpected losses 
ul
 and to  treatment of securitisation  exposures
 in addition to se
 changes in  treatments of credit risk mitigation and  qualifying revolving retail exposures
 among ors
 are also being incorporated
 the  committee also has sought to clarify its expectations regarding  need for banks using   advanced irb approach to incorporate  effects arising from economic downturns into ir  loss-given-default 
lgd
 parameters
    14
       the committee believes it is important to reiterate its objectives regarding   overall level of minimum capital requirements
 these are to broadly maintain  aggregate  level of such requirements
 while also providing incentives to adopt  more advanced  risk-sensitive approaches of  revised framework
 the committee has confirmed  need  to furr review  calibration of  revised framework prior to its implementation
 should   information available at  time of such review reveal   committees objectives  on overall capital would not be achieved
  committee is prepared to take actions necessary  to address  situation
 in particular
 and consistent with  principle  such actions  should be separated from  design of  framework itself
 this would entail  application  of a single scaling factor  which could be eir greater than or less than one  to  irb  capital requirement resulting from  revised framework
 the current best estimate of   scaling factor using quantitative impact study 3 data adjusted for  el-ul decisions is  1
06
 the final determination of any scaling factor will be based on  parallel running  results
 which will reflect all of  elements of  framework to be implemented
    15
      the committee has designed  revised framework to be a more forward-looking  approach to capital adequacy supervision
 one  has  capacity to evolve with time
 this  evolution is necessary to ensure   framework keeps pace with market developments  and advances in risk management practices
 and  committee intends to monitor se  developments and to make revisions when necessary
 in this regard
  committee has  benefited greatly from its frequent interactions with industry participants and looks forward  to enhanced opportunities for dialogue
 the committee also intends to keep  industry  apprised of its future work agenda
    16
      one area where such interaction will be particularly important is in relation to   issue of double default
 the committee believes  recognition of double default effects  is necessary
 though it is essential to consider all of  implications
 especially those related  to measurement
 before a solution is decided upon
 it will continue work with  intention  of finding a prudentially sound solution as promptly as possible prior to  implementation  of  revised framework
 alongside this work
  committee has also begun joint work with   international organization of securities commissions 
iosco
 on various issues relating  to trading activities 
""
 potential future exposure
""
    17
       one area where  committee intends to undertake additional work of a longer
 term nature is in relation to  definition of eligible capital
 one motivation for this is  fact    changes in  treatment of expected and unexpected losses and related changes in   treatment of provisions in  framework set out here generally tend to reduce tier 1  capital requirements relative to total capital requirements
 moreover
 converging on a  uniform international capital standard under this framework will ultimately require   identification of an agreed set of capital instruments  are available to absorb  unanticipated losses on a going-concern basis
 the committee announced its intention to  review  definition of capital as a follow-up to  revised approach to tier 1 eligibility as  announced in its october 1998 press release
 instruments eligible for inclusion in tier 1  capital
 it will explore furr issues surrounding  definition of regulatory capital
 but does  not intend to propose changes as a result of this longer-term review prior to   implementation of  revised framework set out in this document
 in  meantime
   committee will continue its efforts to ensure  consistent application of its 1998 decisions  regarding  composition of regulatory capital across jurisdictions
    18
      the committee also seeks to continue to engage  banking industry in a  discussion of prevailing risk management practices
 including those practices aiming to  produce quantified measures of risk and economic capital
 over  last decade
 a number of  banking organisations have invested resources in modelling  credit risk arising from ir  significant business operations
 such models are intended to assist banks in quantifying
  aggregating and managing credit risk across geographic and product lines
 while   framework presented in this document stops short of allowing  results of such credit risk  models to be used for regulatory capital purposes
  committee recognises  importance  of continued active dialogue regarding both  performance of such models and ir  comparability across banks
 moreover
  committee believes  a successful  implementation of  revised framework will provide banks and supervisors with critical  experience necessary to address such challenges
 the committee understands   irb  approach represents a point on  continuum between purely regulatory measures of credit  risk and an approach  builds more fully on internal credit risk models
 in principle
 furr  movements along  continuum are foreseeable
 subject to an ability to address adequately  concerns about reliability
 comparability
 validation
 and competitive equity
 in  meantime
   committee believes  additional attention to  results of internal credit risk models  in  supervisory review process and in banks disclosures will be highly beneficial for   accumulation of information on  relevant issues
    19

 scope of application      i
           introduction  20
      this framework will be applied on a consolidated basis to internationally active  banks
 this is  best means to preserve  integrity of capital in banks with subsidiaries by  eliminating double gearing
    21
      the scope of application of  framework will include
 on a fully consolidated basis
  any holding company  is  parent entity within a banking group to ensure  it  captures  risk of  whole banking group
  banking groups are groups  engage  predominantly in banking activities and
 in some countries
 a banking group may be  registered as a bank
    22
       the framework will also apply to all internationally active banks at every tier within a  banking group
 also on a fully consolidated basis 
see illustrative chart at  end of this  section
""
  a three-year transitional period for applying full sub-consolidation will be provided  for those countries where this is not currently a requirement
    23
      furr
 as one of  principal objectives of supervision is  protection of  depositors
 it is essential to ensure  capital recognised in capital adequacy measures is  readily available for those depositors
 accordingly
 supervisors should test  individual  banks are adequately capitalised on a stand-alone basis
          ii
         banking
 securities and or financial subsidiaries  24
      to  greatest extent possible
 all banking and or relevant financial activities   
both regulated and unregulated
 conducted within a group containing an internationally  active bank will be captured through consolidation
 thus
 majority-owned or
controlled  banking entities
 securities entities 
where subject to broadly similar regulation or where  securities activities are deemed banking activities
 and or financial entities  should  generally be fully consolidated
    25
     supervisors will assess  appropriateness of recognising in consolidated capital   minority interests  arise from  consolidation of less than wholly owned banking
  securities or or financial entities
 supervisors will adjust  amount of such minority  interests  may be included in capital in  event  capital from such minority interests  is not readily available to or group entities
       a holding company  is a parent of a banking group may itself have a parent holding  company
 in some structures
 this parent holding company may not be subject to this  framework because it is not considered aparent of a banking group
  as an alternative to full sub-consolidation
  application of this framework to  stand- alone bank 
i
e
 on a basis  does not consolidate assets and liabilities of subsidiaries
 would  achieve  same objective
 providing  full book value of any investments in subsidiaries  and significant minority-owned stakes is deducted from  bank  capital
  financial activities do not include insurance activities and financial entities do not include  insurance  entities
    examples of  types of activities  financial entities might be involved in include financial  leasing
 issuing  credit cards
 portfolio management
 investment advisory
 custodial and  safekeeping services and or similar activities  are ancillary to  businessof banking        26
       there may be instances where it is not feasible or desirable to consolidate certain  securities or or regulated financial entities
 this would be only in cases where such  holdings are acquired through debt previously contracted and held on a temporary basis
 are  subject to different regulation
 or where non-consolidation for regulatory capital purposes is  orwise required by law
 in such cases
 it is imperative for  bank supervisor to obtain  sufficient information from supervisors responsible for such entities
    27
      if any majority-owned securities and or financial subsidiaries are not consolidated  for capital purposes
 all equity and or regulatory capital investments in those entities  attributable to  group will be deducted
 and  assets and liabilities
 as well as third-party  capital investments in  subsidiary will be removed from  banks balance sheet
  supervisors will ensure   entity  is not consolidated and for which  capital  investment is deducted meets regulatory capital requirements
 supervisors will monitor  actions taken by  subsidiary to correct any capital shortfall and
 if it is not corrected in a  timely manner
  shortfall will also be deducted from  parent banks capital
          iii
     significant minority investments in banking
 securities and or           financial entities  28
      significant minority investments in banking
 securities and or financial entities
  where control does not exist
 will be excluded from  banking groups capital by deduction  of  equity and or regulatory investments
 alternatively
 such investments might be
  under certain conditions
 consolidated on a pro rata basis
 for example
 pro rata  consolidation may be appropriate for joint ventures or where  supervisor is satisfied    parent is legally or de facto expected to support  entity on a proportionate basis only  and  or significant shareholders have  means and  willingness to proportionately  support it
" the threshold above which minority investments will be deemed significant and be  thus eir deducted or consolidated on a pro-rata basis is to be determined by national  accounting and/or regulatory practices"
 as an example
  threshold for pro-rata inclusion in   european union is defined as equity interests of between 20% and 50%
    29
     the committee reaffirms  view set out in  1988 accord  reciprocal cross
 holdings of bank capital artificially designed to inflate  capital position of banks will be  deducted for capital adequacy purposes
          iv
      insurance entities    30
       a bank  owns an insurance subsidiary bears  full entrepreneurial risks of   subsidiary and should recognise on a group-wide basis  risks included in  whole group
  when measuring regulatory capital for banks
  committee believes  at this stage it is
  in principle
 appropriate to deduct banks equity and or regulatory capital investments in  insurance subsidiaries and also significant minority investments in insurance entities
 under  this approach  bank would remove from its balance sheet assets and liabilities
 as well as  third party capital investments in an insurance subsidiary
 alternative approaches  can be  applied should
 in any case
 include a group-wide perspective for determining capital  adequacy and avoid double counting of capital
    31
      due to issues of competitive equality
 some g10 countries will retain ir existing  risk weighting treatment as an exception to  approaches described above and introduce  risk aggregation only on a consistent basis to  applied domestically by insurance  supervisors for insurance firms with banking subsidiaries
  the committee invites insurance  supervisors to develop furr and adopt approaches  comply with  above standards
    32
     banks should disclose  national regulatory approach used with respect to  insurance entities in determining ir reported capital positions
    33
       the capital invested in a majority-owned or controlled insurance entity may exceed   amount of regulatory capital required for such an entity 
surplus capital
""
 supervisors may  permit  recognition of such surplus capital in calculating a banks capital adequacy
 under  limited circumstances
  national regulatory practices will determine  parameters and  criteria
 such as legal transferability
 for assessing  amount and availability of surplus  capital  could be recognised in bank capital
 or examples of availability criteria  include
 restrictions on transferability due to regulatory constraints
 to tax implications and to  adverse impacts on external credit assessment institutions ratings
 banks recognising  surplus capital in insurance subsidiaries will publicly disclose  amount of such surplus  capital recognised in ir capital
 where a bank does not have a full ownership interest in an  insurance entity 
""
 50% or more but less than 100% interest
""
 surplus capital recognised  should be proportionate to  percentage interest held
 surplus capital in significant  minority-owned insurance entities will not be recognised
 as  bank would not be in a  position to direct  transfer of  capital in an entity which it does not control
    34
       supervisors will ensure  majority-owned or controlled insurance subsidiaries
  which are not consolidated and for which capital investments are deducted or subject to an  alternative group-wide approach
 are mselves adequately capitalised to reduce   possibility of future potential losses to  bank
 supervisors will monitor actions taken by   subsidiary to correct any capital shortfall and
 if it is not corrected in a timely manner
   shortfall will also be deducted from  parent banks capital
          for banks using  standardised approach this would mean applying no less than a 100% risk  weight
 while      for banks on  irb approach
  appropriate risk weight based on  irb rules shall apply  to such      investments
   where  existing treatment is retained
 third party capital invested in  insurance  subsidiary 
i
e
 minority      interests
 cannot be included in  banks capital adequacy measurement
   in a deduction approach
  amount deducted for all equity and or regulatory capital  investments will be      adjusted to reflect  amount of capital in those entities  is in surplus to regulatory  requirements
 i
e
       amount deducted would be  lesser of  investment or  regulatory capital  requirement
 the amount      representing  surplus capital
 i
e
  difference between  amount of  investment  in those entities and      ir regulatory capital requirement
 would be risk-weighted as an equity investment
 if  using an alternative      group-wide approach
 an equivalent treatment of surplus capital will be made
  v
      significant investments in commercial entities    35
     significant minority and majority investments in commercial entities which exceed  certain materiality levels will be deducted from banks capital
" materiality levels will be  determined by national accounting and/or regulatory practices"
 materiality levels of 15% of   banks capital for individual significant investments in commercial entities and 60% of   banks capital for  aggregate of such investments
 or stricter levels
 will be applied
 the  amount to be deducted will be  portion of  investment  exceeds  materiality  level
    36
       investments in significant minority
and majority-owned and
controlled commercial  entities below  materiality levels noted above will be risk-weighted at no lower than 100%  for banks using  standardised approach
 for banks using  irb approach
   investment would be risk weighted in accordance with  methodology  committee is  developing for equities and would not be less than 100%
          vi
     deduction of investments pursuant to this part  37
      where deductions of investments are made pursuant to this part on scope of  application
  deductions will be 50% from tier 1 and 50% from tier 2 capital
    38
      goodwill relating to entities subject to a deduction approach pursuant to this part  should be deducted from tier 1 in  same manner as goodwill relating to consolidated  subsidiaries
 and  remainder of  investments should be deducted as provided for in this  part
 a similar treatment of goodwill should be applied
 if using an alternative group-wide  approach pursuant to paragraph 30
    39
      the limits on tier 2 and tier 3 capital and on innovative tier 1 instruments will be  based on  amount of tier 1 capital after deduction of goodwill but before  deductions  of  investments pursuant to this part on scope of application 
see annex 1 for an example how  to calculate  15% limit for innovative tier 1 instruments

  committee believes it is appropriate for  supervisors to continue to apply prudential floors  similar to those of paragraph 46  to  provide time to ensure  individual bank implementations of  advanced approaches are  sound
 however
  committee recognises  floors based on  1988 accord will  become increasingly impractical to implement over time and refore believes   supervisors should have  flexibility to develop appropriate bank-by-bank floors  are  consistent with  principles outlined in this paragraph

          credit risk  the standardised approach  50
     the committee proposes to permit banks a choice between two broad  methodologies for calculating ir capital requirements for credit risk
 one alternative will be  to measure credit risk in a standardised manner
 supported by external credit assessments
    51
     the alternative methodology
 which is subject to  explicit approval of  banks  supervisor
 would allow banks to use ir internal rating systems for credit risk
    52
      the following section sets out revisions to  1988 accord for risk weighting  banking book exposures
 exposures  are not explicitly addressed in this section will  retain  current treatment
 however
 exposures related to securitisation are dealt with in  section iv
 in determining  risk weights in  standardised approach
 banks may use  assessments by external credit assessment institutions recognised as eligible for capital  purposes by national supervisors in accordance with  criteria defined in paragraphs 90  and 91
 exposures should be risk-weighted net of specific provisions

 to qualify
 an eca must  publish its risk scores and subscribe to  oecd agreed methodology
 banks may choose  to use  risk scores published by individual ecas  are recognised by ir supervisor
  or  consensus risk scores of ecas participating in  arrangement on officially  supported export credits
  the oecd agreed methodology establishes eight risk score  categories associated with minimum export insurance premiums

    the following examples outline how pses might be categorised when focusing on one specific  feature
       namely revenue raising powers
 however
 re may be or ways of determining   different treatments       applicable to different types of pses

  regional governments and local authorities could qualify for  same treatment as  claims on ir           sovereign or central government if se governments and local authorities have specific  revenue raising           powers and have specific institutional arrangements  effect of which is to reduce ir  risks of default
       
  administrative bodies responsible to central governments
 regional governments or to  local           authorities and or non-commercial undertakings owned by  governments or local  authorities           may not warrant  same treatment as claims on ir sovereign if  entities do not  have revenue raising           powers or or arrangements as described above
 if strict lending rules apply to se  entities and a           declaration of bankruptcy is not possible because of ir special public status
 it may be  appropriate to           treat se claims in  same manner as claims on banks
       
  commercial undertakings owned by central governments
 regional governments or by  local authorities           may be treated as normal commercial enterprises
 however
 if se entities function as  a corporate in           competitive markets even though  state

          claims on banks  60
      there are two options for claims on banks
 national supervisors will apply one  option to all banks in ir jurisdiction
 no claim on an unrated bank may receive a risk weight  lower than  applied to claims on its sovereign of incorporation
    61
      under  first option
 all banks incorporated in a given country will be assigned a  risk weight one category less favourable than  assigned to claims on  sovereign of   country
 however
 for claims on banks in countries with sovereigns rated bb
 to b
and on  banks in unrated countries  risk weight will be capped at 100%
    62
      the second option bases  risk weighting on  external credit assessment of   bank itself with claims on unrated banks being risk-weighted at 50%
 under this option
 a  preferential risk weight  is one category more favourable may be applied to claims with  an original maturity of three months or less
 subject to a floor of 20%
 this treatment will be  available to both rated and unrated banks
 but not to banks risk weighted at 150%

  committee holds to  view  mortgages on commercial real estate do not
  in principle
 justify or than a 100% weighting of  loans secured
             the committee
 however
 recognises 
 in exceptional circumstances for well-developed  and long
      established markets
" mortgages on office and/or multi-purpose commercial premises  and/or multi-tenanted       commercial premises may have  potential to receive a preferential risk weight of 50%  for  tranche of        loan  does not exceed  lower of 50% of  market value or 60% of  mortgage  lending value of        property securing  loan"
 any exposure beyond se limits will receive a 100% risk  weight
 this exceptional       treatment will be subject to very strict conditions
 in particular
 two tests must be fulfilled

      b
      external credit assessments  1
      the recognition process  90
       national supervisors are responsible for determining wher an external credit  assessment institution 
ecai
 meets  criteria listed in  paragraph below
 the  assessments of ecais may be recognised on a limited basis
 
 by type of claims or by  jurisdiction
 the supervisory process for recognising ecais should be made public to avoid  unnecessary barriers to entry
      2
      eligibility criteria  91
     an ecai must satisfy each of  following six criteria
    objectivity
 the methodology for assigning credit assessments must be rigorous
          systematic
 and subject to some form of validation based on historical experience
          moreover
 assessments must be subject to ongoing review and responsive to          changes in financial condition
 before being recognised by supervisors
 an          assessment methodology for each market segment
 including rigorous backtesting
          must have been established for at least one year and preferably three years
  independence
 an ecai should be independent and should not be subject to          political or economic pressures  may influence  rating
 the assessment          process should be as free as possible from any constraints  could arise in          situations where  composition of  board of directors or  shareholder          structure of  assessment institution may be seen as creating a conflict of interest
"  international access/transparency"
 the individual assessments should be          available to both domestic and foreign institutions with legitimate interests and at          equivalent terms
 in addition
  general methodology used by  ecai should be          publicly available
  disclosure
 an ecai should disclose  following information
 its assessment          methodologies
 including  definition of default
  time horizon
 and  meaning          of each rating
  actual default rates experienced in each assessment category
          and  transitions of  assessments
 
  likelihood of aa ratings becoming a          over time
  resources
 an ecai should have sufficient resources to carry out high quality          credit assessments
 these resources should allow for substantial ongoing contact          with senior and operational levels within  entities assessed in order to add value          to  credit assessments
 such assessments should be based on methodologies          combining qualitative and quantitative approaches
  credibility
 to some extent
 credibility is derived from  criteria above
 in addition
           reliance on an ecais external credit assessments by independent parties          
investors
 insurers
 trading partners
 is evidence of  credibility of           assessments of an ecai
 the credibility of an ecai is also underpinned by           existence of internal procedures to prevent  misuse of confidential information
 in          order to be eligible for recognition
 an ecai does not have to assess firms in more          than one country
  c
      implementation considerations  1
      the mapping process  92
       supervisors will be responsible for assigning eligible ecais assessments to  risk  weights available under  standardised risk weighting framework
 i
e
 deciding which  assessment categories correspond to which risk weights
 the mapping process should be  objective and should result in a risk weight assignment consistent with  of  level of  credit risk reflected in  tables above
 it should cover  full spectrum of risk weights
    93
      when conducting such a mapping process
 factors  supervisors should assess  include
 among ors
  size and scope of  pool of issuers  each ecai covers
   range and meaning of  assessments  it assigns
 and  definition of default used by   ecai
 in order to promote a more consistent mapping of assessments into  available  risk weights and help supervisors in conducting such a process
 annex 2 provides guidance  as to how such a mapping process may be conducted
    94
      banks must use  chosen ecais and ir ratings consistently for each type of  claim
 for both risk weighting and risk management purposes
 banks will not be allowed to  cherry-pick  assessments provided by different ecais
    95
      banks must disclose ecais  y use for  risk weighting of ir assets by  type of claims
  risk weights associated with  particular rating grades as determined by  supervisors through  mapping process as well as  aggregated risk-weighted assets for  each risk weight based on  assessments of each eligible ecai
      2
      multiple assessments  96
      if re is only one assessment by an ecai chosen by a bank for a particular claim
   assessment should be used to determine  risk weight of  claim
    97
      if re are two assessments by ecais chosen by a bank which map into different  risk weights
  higher risk weight will be applied
    98
      if re are three or more assessments with different risk weights
  assessments  corresponding to  two lowest risk weights should be referred to and  higher of those  two risk weights will be applied
      3
      issuer versus issues assessment  99
      where a bank invests in a particular issue  has an issue-specific assessment
   risk weight of  claim will be based on this assessment
 where  banks claim is not  an investment in a specific assessed issue
  following general principles apply
    in circumstances where  borrower has a specific assessment for an issued debt 
         but  banks claim is not an investment in this particular debt  a high quality          credit assessment 
one which maps into a risk weight lower than  which applies          to an unrated claim
 on  specific debt may only be applied to  banks          unassessed claim if this claim ranks pari passu or senior to  claim with an          assessment in all respects
 if not
  credit assessment cannot be used and           unassessed claim will receive  risk weight for unrated claims
  in circumstances where  borrower has an issuer assessment
 this assessment          typically applies to senior unsecured claims on  issuer
 consequently
 only          senior claims on  issuer will benefit from a high quality issuer assessment
 or          unassessed claims of a highly assessed issuer will be treated as unrated
 if eir  100
    wher  bank intends to rely on an issuer
or an issue-specific assessment
   assessment must take into account and reflect  entire amount of credit risk exposure   bank has with regard to all payments owed to it
    101
     in order to avoid any double counting of credit enhancement factors
 no supervisory  recognition of credit risk mitigation techniques will be taken into account if  credit  enhancement is already reflected in  issue specific rating 
see paragraph 114
""
      4
          domestic currency and foreign currency assessments  102
     where unrated exposures are risk weighted based on  rating of an equivalent  exposure to  borrower
  general rule is  foreign currency ratings would be used for  exposures in foreign currency
 domestic currency ratings
 if separate
 would only be used to  risk weight claims denominated in  domestic currency
      5
"          short-term/long-term assessments  103"
      for risk-weighting purposes
 short-term assessments are deemed to be issue
 specific
 they can only be used to derive risk weights for claims arising from  rated facility
  they cannot be generalised to or short-term claims
 except under  conditions of  paragraph 105
 in no event can a short-term rating be used to support a risk weight for an  unrated long-term claim
 short-term assessments may only be used for short-term claims  against banks and corporates
 the table below provides a framework for banks exposures to  specific short-term facilities
 such as a particular issuance of commercial paper
"         credit assessment              a-1/p-1            a-2/p-2             a-3/p-3             ors       risk weight                        20%                 50%                100%                 150%    104"
      if a short-term rated facility attracts a 50% risk-weight
 unrated short-term claims  cannot attract a risk weight lower than 100%
 if an issuer has a short-term facility with an  assessment  warrants a risk weight of 150%
 all unrated claims
 wher long-term or  short-term
 should also receive a 150% risk weight
 unless  bank uses recognised credit  risk mitigation techniques for such claims
             for example
 if a bank is owed both principal and interest
  assessment must fully take  into account and       reflect  credit risk associated with repayment of both principal and interest
  however
 when an exposure arises through a bank  participation in a loan  has been  extended
 or has       been guaranteed against convertibility and transfer risk
 by certain mdbs
 its convertibility  and transfer risk       can be considered by national supervisory authorities to be effectively mitigated
 to qualify
  mdbs must have       preferred creditor status recognised in  market and be included in footnote 20
 in such  cases
 for risk       weighting purposes
  borrower  domestic currency rating may be used for  part of   loan  has       been guaranteed instead of its foreign currency rating
 the portion of  loan not  benefiting from such a       guarantee will be risk-weighted based on  foreign currency rating
  the notations follow  methodology used by standard & poor  and by moodys investors  service
 the a-1       rating of standard & poor  includes both a-1
 and a-1-
  this category includes all non-prime and b or c ratings
  105
     in cases where national supervisors have decided to apply option 2 under   standardised approach to short term interbank claims to banks in ir jurisdiction
  inter
 action with specific short-term assessments is expected to be  following
    the general preferential treatment for short-term claims
 as defined under           paragraphs 62 and 64
 applies to all claims on banks of up to three months original           maturity when re is no specific short-term claim assessment
  when re is a short-term assessment and such an assessment maps into a risk           weight  is more favourable 
i
e
 lower
 or identical to  derived from            general preferential treatment
  short-term assessment should be used for            specific claim only
 or short-term claims would benefit from  general           preferential treatment
  when a specific short-term assessment for a short term claim on a bank maps into a           less favourable 
higher
 risk weight
  general short-term preferential treatment for           interbank claims cannot be used
 all unrated short-term claims should receive            same risk weighting as  implied by  specific short-term assessment
  106
     when a short-term assessment is to be used
  institution making  assessment  needs to meet all of  eligibility criteria for recognising ecais as presented in paragraph 91  in terms of its short-term assessment
      6
       level of application of  assessment  107
     external assessments for one entity within a corporate group cannot be used to risk  weight or entities within  same group
      7
       unsolicited ratings  108
      as a general rule
 banks should use solicited ratings from eligible ecais
 national  supervisory authorities may
 however
 allow banks to use unsolicited ratings in  same way  as solicited ratings
 however
 re may be  potential for ecais to use unsolicited ratings  to put pressure on entities to obtain solicited ratings
 such behaviour
 when identified
 should  cause supervisors to consider wher to continue recognising such ecais as eligible for  capital adequacy purposes
      d
       the standardised approach  credit risk mitigation  1
       overarching issues  
i
      introduction  109
     banks use a number of techniques to mitigate  credit risks to which y are  exposed
 for example
 exposures may be collateralised by first priority claims
 in whole or in  part with cash or securities
 a loan exposure may be guaranteed by a third party
 or a bank  may buy a credit derivative to offset various forms of credit risk
 additionally banks may  agree to net loans owed to m against deposits from  same counterparty
    110
      where se techniques meet  requirements for legal certainty as described in  paragraph 117 and 118 below
  revised approach to crm allows a wider range of credit  risk mitigants to be recognised for regulatory capital purposes than is permitted under   1988 accord
  
ii
         general remarks  111
      the framework set out in this section ii is applicable to  banking book exposures  in  standardised approach
 for  treatment of crm in  irb approach
 see section iii
    112
     the comprehensive approach for  treatment of collateral 
see paragraphs 130 to  138 and 145 to 181
 will also be applied to calculate  counterparty risk charges for otc  derivatives and repo-style transactions booked in  trading book
    113
    no transaction in which crm techniques are used should receive a higher capital  requirement than an orwise identical transaction where such techniques are not used
    114
     the effects of crm will not be double counted
 therefore
 no additional supervisory  recognition of crm for regulatory capital purposes will be granted on claims for which an  issue-specific rating is used  already reflects  crm
 as stated in paragraph 100 of   section on  standardised approach
 principal-only ratings will also not be allowed within   framework of crm
    115
      while  use of crm techniques reduces or transfers credit risk
 it simultaneously  may increase or risks 
residual risks
""
 residual risks include legal
 operational
 liquidity  and market risks
 therefore
 it is imperative  banks employ robust procedures and  processes to control se risks
 including strategy
 consideration of  underlying credit
  valuation
 policies and procedures
 systems
 control of roll-off risks
 and management of  concentration risk arising from  banks use of crm techniques and its interaction with   banks overall credit risk profile
 where se risks are not adequately controlled
 supervisors  may impose additional capital charges or take or supervisory actions as outlined in  pillar 2
    116
     the pillar 3 requirements must also be observed for banks to obtain capital relief in  respect of any crm techniques
    
iii
        legal certainty  117
     in order for banks to obtain capital relief for any use of crm techniques
   following minimum standards for legal documentation must be met
    118
     all documentation used in collateralised transactions and for documenting on
 balance sheet netting
 guarantees and credit derivatives must be binding on all parties and  legally enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions
 banks must have conducted sufficient legal  review to verify this and have a well founded legal basis to reach this conclusion
 and  undertake such furr review as necessary to ensure continuing enforceability
      2
           overview of credit risk mitigation techniques   
i
          collateralised transactions  119
         a collateralised transaction is one in which
    banks have a credit exposure or potential credit exposure
 and          see annex 8 for an overview of methodologies for  capital treatment of transactions  secured by financial         collateral under  standardised and irb approaches
   credit exposure or potential credit exposure is hedged in whole or in part by              collateral posted by a counterparty or by a third party on behalf of               counterparty
  120
      where banks take eligible financial collateral 
""
 cash or securities
 more  specifically defined in paragraphs 145 and 146 below
""
 y are allowed to reduce ir credit  exposure to a counterparty when calculating ir capital requirements to take account of   risk mitigating effect of  collateral
    overall framework and minimum conditions  121
      banks may opt for eir  simple approach
 which
 similar to  1988 accord
  substitutes  risk weighting of  collateral for  risk weighting of  counterparty for    collateralised portion of  exposure 
generally subject to a 20% floor
""
 or for   comprehensive approach
 which allows fuller offset of collateral against exposures
 by  effectively reducing  exposure amount by  value ascribed to  collateral
 banks may  operate under eir
 but not both
 approaches in  banking book
 but only under   comprehensive approach in  trading book
 partial collateralisation is recognised in both  approaches
 mismatches in  maturity of  underlying exposure and  collateral will  only be allowed under  comprehensive approach
    122
    however
 before capital relief will be granted in respect of any form of collateral
   standards set out below in paragraphs 123 to 126 must be met under eir approach
    123
       in addition to  general requirements for legal certainty set out in paragraphs 117  and 118
  legal mechanism by which collateral is pledged or transferred must ensure    bank has  right to liquidate or take legal possession of it
 in a timely manner
 in   event of  default
 insolvency or bankruptcy 
or one or more orwise-defined credit  events set out in  transaction documentation
 of  counterparty 
and
 where applicable
  of  custodian holding  collateral
""
 furrmore banks must take all steps necessary to  fulfil those requirements under  law applicable to  banks interest in  collateral for  obtaining and maintaining an enforceable security interest
 
 by registering it with a  registrar
 or for exercising a right to net or set off in relation to title transfer collateral
    124
     in order for collateral to provide protection
  credit quality of  counterparty and   value of  collateral must not have a material positive correlation
 for example
  securities issued by  counterparty  or by any related group entity  would provide little  protection and so would be ineligible
    125
      banks must have clear and robust procedures for  timely liquidation of collateral  to ensure  any legal conditions required for declaring  default of  counterparty and  liquidating  collateral are observed
 and  collateral can be liquidated promptly
    126
    where  collateral is held by a custodian
 banks must take reasonable steps to  ensure   custodian segregates  collateral from its own assets
    127
     a capital requirement will be applied to a bank on eir side of  collateralised  transaction
 for example
 both repos and reverse repos will be subject to capital      in this section counterparty is used to denote a party to whom a bank has an on
or off- balance sheet credit       exposure or a potential credit exposure
 that exposure may
 for example
 take  form of  a loan of cash or       securities 
where  counterparty would traditionally be called  borrower
""
 of securities  posted as       collateral
 of a commitment or of exposure under an otc derivatives contract
  requirements
 likewise
 both sides of a securities lending and borrowing transaction will be  subject to explicit capital charges
 as will  posting of securities in connection with a  derivative exposure or or borrowing
    128
      where a bank
 acting as an agent
 arranges a repo-style transaction  
i
e
" repurchase/reverse repurchase and securities lending/borrowing transactions"
 between  a customer and a third party and provides a guarantee to  customer   third party  will perform on its obligations
 n  risk to  bank is  same as if  bank had  entered into  transaction as a principal
 in such circumstances
 a bank will be required to  calculate capital requirements as if it were itself  principal
    the simple approach  129
    in  simple approach  risk weighting of  collateral instrument collateralising  or partially collateralising  exposure is substituted for  risk weighting of   counterparty
 details of this framework are provided in paragraphs 182 to 185
    the comprehensive approach  130
       in  comprehensive approach
 when taking collateral
 banks will need to calculate  ir adjusted exposure to a counterparty for capital adequacy purposes in order to take  account of  effects of  collateral
 using haircuts
 banks are required to adjust both   amount of  exposure to  counterparty and  value of any collateral received in  support of  counterparty to take account of possible future fluctuations in  value of  eir
 occasioned by market movements
 this will produce volatility adjusted amounts for  both exposure and collateral
 unless eir side of  transaction is cash
  volatility  adjusted amount for  exposure will be higher than  exposure and for  collateral it  will  be lower
    131
     additionally where  exposure and collateral are held in different currencies an  additional downwards adjustment must be made to  volatility adjusted collateral amount  to  take account of possible future fluctuations in exchange rates
    132
     where  volatility-adjusted exposure amount is greater than  volatility-adjusted  collateral amount 
including any furr adjustment for foreign exchange risk
""
 banks shall  calculate ir risk-weighted assets as  difference between  two multiplied by  risk  weight of  counterparty
 the framework for performing se calculations is set out in  paragraphs 147 to 150
    133
    in principle
 banks have two ways of calculating  haircuts
 
i
 standard  supervisory haircuts
 using parameters set by  committee
 and 
ii
 own-estimate haircuts
  using banks own internal estimates of market price volatility
 supervisors will allow banks to  use own-estimate haircuts only when y fulfil certain qualitative and quantitative criteria
    134
      a bank may choose to use standard or own-estimate haircuts independently of   choice it has made between  standardised approach and  foundation irb approach to  credit risk
 however
 if banks seek to use ir own-estimate haircuts
 y must do so for   full range of instrument types for which y would be eligible to use own-estimates
   exception being immaterial portfolios where y may use  standard supervisory haircuts
        exposure amounts may vary where
 for example
 securities are being lent
  135
     the size of  individual haircuts will depend on  type of instrument
 type of  transaction and  frequency of marking-to-market and remargining
 for example
 repo
 style transactions subject to daily marking-to-market and to daily remargining will receive a  haircut based on a 5-business day holding period and secured lending transactions with daily  mark-to-market and no remargining clauses will receive a haircut based on a 20-business  day holding period
 these haircut numbers will be scaled up using  square root of time  formula depending on  frequency of remargining or marking-to-market
    136
    for certain types of repo-style transactions 
broadly speaking government bond  repos as defined in paragraphs 170 and 171
 supervisors may allow banks using standard  supervisory haircuts or own-estimate haircuts not to apply se in calculating  exposure  amount after risk mitigation
    137
    the effect of master netting agreements covering repo-style transactions can be  recognised for  calculation of capital requirements subject to  conditions in paragraph  173
    138
     as a furr alternative to standard supervisory haircuts and own-estimate haircuts  banks may use var models for calculating potential price volatility for repo-style transactions  as set out in paragraphs 178 to 181 below
    
ii
     on-balance sheet netting  139

 as under  1988  accord
 a substitution approach will be applied
 thus only guarantees issued by or protection  provided by entities with a lower risk weight than  counterparty will lead to reduced capital  charges since  protected portion of  counterparty exposure is assigned  risk weight  of  guarantor or protection provider

     the intention here is to obtain a net exposure amount after netting of  exposures  and collateral and have an add-on amount reflecting possible price changes for  securities  involved in  transactions and for foreign exchange risk if any
 the net long or short  position of each security included in  netting agreement will be multiplied by   appropriate haircut

     as an alternative to  use of standard or own-estimate haircuts
 banks may be  permitted to use a var models approach to reflect  price volatility of  exposure and  collateral for repo-style transactions

 the var models approach is available to banks   have received supervisory recognition for an internal market risk model under  market  risk amendment
 banks which have not received supervisory recognition for use of models  under  market risk amendment can separately apply for supervisory recognition to use  ir internal var models for calculation of potential price volatility for repo-style transactions
  internal models will only be accepted when a bank can prove  quality of its model to   supervisor through  backtesting of its output using one year of historical data
      the holding period for  haircuts will depend as in or repo-style transactions on   frequency of       margining
  the starting point for this formula is  formula in paragraph 147 which can also be presented  as        following        179
      the quantitative and qualitative criteria for recognition of internal market risk models  for repo-style transactions and or similar transactions are in principle  same as under   market risk amendment

 for each day and for  sample of 20 counterparties
   bank must compare  previous days var estimate for  counterparty portfolio to   change in  exposure of  previous days portfolio
 this change is  difference between   net value of  previous days portfolio using todays market prices and  net value of   portfolio using  previous days market prices
 where this difference exceeds   previous days var estimate

a
    sovereign counter-guarantee covers all credit risk elements of  claim
          
b
   both  original guarantee and  counter-guarantee meet all operational              requirements for guarantees

 and          
c
    supervisor is satisfied   cover is robust and  no historical              evidence suggests   coverage of  counter-guarantee is less than              effectively equivalent to  of a direct sovereign guarantee

          maturity mismatches  202
    for  purposes of calculating risk-weighted assets
 a maturity mismatch occurs  when  residual maturity of a hedge is less than  of  underlying exposure
    
i
         definition of maturity  203
     the maturity of  underlying exposure and  maturity of  hedge should both  be defined conservatively
 the effective maturity of  underlying should be gauged as   longest possible remaining time before  counterparty is scheduled to fulfil its obligation
  taking into account any applicable grace period
 for  hedge
 embedded options which  may reduce  term of  hedge should be taken into account so   shortest possible  effective maturity is used
 where a call is at  discretion of  protection seller
   maturity will always be at  first call date
 if  call is at  discretion of  protection  buying bank but  terms of  arrangement at origination of  hedge contain a positive  incentive for  bank to call  transaction before contractual maturity
  remaining time  to  first call date will be deemed to be  effective maturity
 for example
 where re is  a  step-up in cost in conjunction with a call feature or where  effective cost of cover  increases over time even if credit quality remains  same or increases
  effective  maturity will be  remaining time to  first call
    
ii
     risk weights for maturity mismatches  204
    as outlined in paragraph 143
 hedges with maturity mismatches are only recognised  when ir original maturities are greater than or equal to one year
 as a result
  maturity  of hedges for exposures with original maturities of less than one year must be matched to be  recognised
 in all cases

""
  bank will  be required to subdivide  exposure into portions covered by each type of crm technique

ii
     first-to-default credit derivatives  207
     there are cases where a bank obtains credit protection for a basket of reference  names and where  first default among  reference names triggers  credit protection  and  credit event also terminates  contract
 in this case
  bank may recognise  regulatory capital relief for  asset within  basket with  lowest risk-weighted amount
  but only if  notional amount is less than or equal to  notional amount of  credit  derivative
    208
    with regard to  bank providing credit protection through such an instrument
 if   product has an external credit assessment from an eligible credit assessment institution
   risk weight in paragraph 567 applied to securitisation tranches will be applied
 if  product  is not rated by an eligible external credit assessment institution
  risk weights of  assets  included in  basket will be aggregated up to a maximum of 1250% and multiplied by   nominal amount of  protection provided by  credit derivative to obtain  risk- weighted  asset amount
    
iii
    second-to-default credit derivatives  209
     in  case where  second default among  assets within  basket triggers   credit protection
  bank obtaining credit protection through such a product will only be  able to recognise any capital relief if first-default-protection has also be obtained or when one  of  assets within  basket has already defaulted
    210
     for banks providing credit protection through such a product
  capital treatment is   same as in paragraph 208 above with one exception
 the exception is 
 in  aggregating  risk weights
  asset with  lowest risk weighted amount can be excluded  from  calculation

       categorisation of exposures  215
     under  irb approach

 the classes of assets are 
a
 corporate
 
b
 sovereign
 
c

 five sub-classes of specialised lending are  separately identified
 within  retail asset class
 three sub-classes are separately identified

 a distinct treatment for purchased receivables  may also apply provided certain conditions are met

     the classification of exposures in this way is broadly consistent with established  bank practice
 however
 some banks may use different definitions in ir internal risk  management and measurement systems
 while it is not  intention of  committee to  require banks to change  way in which y manage ir business and risks

 each of se sub-classes is defined below
    project finance  221
     project finance 
pf
 is a method of funding in which  lender looks primarily to   revenues generated by a single project
 both as  source of repayment and as security for   exposure
 this type of financing is usually for large
 complex and expensive installations   might include
 for example
 power plants
 chemical processing plants
 mines
  transportation infrastructure
 environment
 and telecommunications infrastructure
 project  finance may take  form of financing of  construction of a new capital installation
 or  refinancing of an existing installation
 with or without improvements

 the consequence is   repayment depends primarily on  projects cash flow and on  collateral value of   projects assets
 in contrast
 if repayment of  exposure depends primarily on a well  established
 diversified
 credit-worthy
 contractually obligated end user for repayment
 it is  considered a secured exposure to  end-user

 a primary source of se cash flows might be rental or  lease contracts with one or several third parties
 in contrast
 if  exposure is to a borrower  whose financial condition and debt-servicing capacity enables it to repay  debt without  undue reliance on  specifically pledged assets
  exposure should be treated as a  collateralised corporate exposure
    commodities finance  224
      commodities finance

 where  exposure will be repaid from  proceeds of  sale of  commodity  and  borrower has no independent capacity to repay  exposure
 this is  case when   borrower has no or activities and no or material assets on its balance sheet

 refers to a method of providing funding to real  estate 
such as

 bank exposures also include claims on domestic pses  are treated like  claims on banks under  standardised approach
 and mdbs  do not meet  criteria  for a 0% risk weight under  standardised approach
    
iv
    definition of retail exposures  231
      an exposure is categorised as a retail exposure if it meets all of  following  criteria
    nature of borrower or low value of individual exposures  exposures to individuals  such as revolving credits and lines of credit 
""
 credit          cards
 overdrafts
 and retail facilities secured by financial instruments

 personal finance
 and or exposures with similar          characteristics
  are generally eligible for retail treatment regardless of exposure          size
 although supervisors may wish to establish exposure thresholds to distinguish          between retail and corporate exposures
  residential mortgage loans 
including first and subsequent liens
 term loans and          revolving home equity lines of credit
 are eligible for retail treatment regardless of          exposure size so long as  credit is extended to an individual  is an owner
         occupier of  property 
with  understanding  supervisors exercise          reasonable flexibility regarding buildings containing only a few rental units           orwise y are treated as corporate
""
 loans secured by a single or small number          of condominium or co-operative residential housing units in a single building or          complex also fall within  scope of  residential mortgage category
 national          supervisors may set limits on  maximum number of housing units per exposure
  loans extended to small businesses and managed as retail exposures are eligible          for retail treatment provided  total exposure of  banking group to a small          business borrower 
on a consolidated basis where applicable
 is less than          1 million
 small business loans extended through or guaranteed by an individual          are subject to  same exposure threshold
  it is expected  supervisors provide flexibility in  practical application of such          thresholds such  banks are not forced to develop extensive new information          systems simply for  purpose of ensuring perfect compliance
 it is
 however
          important for supervisors to ensure  such flexibility 
and  implied acceptance  large number of exposures  232
     the exposure must be one of a large pool of exposures
 which are managed by   bank on a pooled basis
 supervisors may choose to set a minimum number of exposures  within a pool for exposures in  pool to be treated as retail
    small business exposures below 1 million may be treated as retail exposures if            bank treats such exposures in its internal risk management systems consistently           over time and in  same manner as or retail exposures
 this requires  such           an exposure be originated in a similar manner to or retail exposures
           furrmore
 it must not be managed individually in a way comparable to corporate           exposures
 but rar as part of a portfolio segment or pool of exposures with similar           risk characteristics for purposes of risk assessment and quantification
 however
 this           does not preclude retail exposures from being treated individually at some stages of            risk management process
 the fact  an exposure is rated individually does           not by itself deny  eligibility as a retail exposure
  233
     within  retail asset class category
 banks are required to identify separately three  sub-classes of exposures
 
a
 exposures secured by residential properties as defined above
  
b
 qualifying revolving retail exposures
 as defined in  following paragraph
 and 
c
 all  or retail exposures
    
v
      definition of qualifying revolving retail exposures  234
     all of  following criteria must be satisfied for a sub-portfolio to be treated as a  qualifying revolving retail exposure 
qrre
""
 these criteria must be applied at a sub-portfolio  level consistent with  banks segmentation of its retail activities generally
 segmentation  at   national or country level 
or below
 should be  general rule
  
a
      the exposures are revolving
 unsecured
 and uncommitted 
both contractually and           in practice
""
 in this context
 revolving exposures are defined as those where           customers outstanding balances are permitted to fluctuate based on ir decisions           to borrow and repay
 up to a limit established by  bank
  
b
      the exposures are to individuals
  
c
      the maximum exposure to a single individual in  sub-portfolio is 100
000 or           less
  
d
      because  asset correlation assumptions for  qrre risk-weight function are           markedly below those for  or retail risk-weight function at low pd values
           banks must demonstrate   use of  qrre risk-weight function is           constrained to portfolios  have exhibited low volatility of loss rates
 relative to           ir average level of loss rates
 especially within  low pd bands
 supervisors will           review  relative volatility of loss rates across  qrre subportfolios
 as well as            aggregate qrre portfolio
 and intend to share information on  typical           characteristics of qrre loss rates across jurisdictions
  
e
      data on loss rates for  sub-portfolio must be retained in order to allow analysis of            volatility of loss rates
  
f
      the supervisor must concur  treatment as a qualifying revolving retail exposure           is consistent with  underlying risk characteristics of  sub-portfolio
  
vi
        definition of equity exposures  235
      in general
 equity exposures are defined on  basis of  economic substance of   instrument
 they include both direct and indirect ownership interests
 wher voting or  non-voting
 in  assets and income of a commercial enterprise or of a financial institution   is not consolidated or deducted pursuant to part 1 of this framework
 an instrument is  considered to be an equity exposure if it meets all of  following requirements
    it is irredeemable in  sense   return of invested funds can be achieved only              by  sale of  investment or sale of  rights to  investment or by               liquidation of  issuer
  it does not embody an obligation on  part of  issuer
 and  it conveys a residual claim on  assets or income of  issuer
  236
    additionally any of  following instruments must be categorised as an equity  exposure
    an instrument with  same structure as those permitted as tier 1 capital for              banking organisations
  an instrument  embodies an obligation on  part of  issuer and meets any              of  following conditions
              
1
        the issuer may defer indefinitely  settlement of  obligation
                
2
        the obligation requires 
or permits at  issuers discretion
 settlement by                         issuance of a fixed number of  issuers equity shares
                
3
        the obligation requires 
or permits at  issuers discretion
 settlement by                         issuance of a variable number of  issuers equity shares and 
ceteris                         paribus
 any change in  value of  obligation is attributable to
                         comparable to
 and in  same direction as
  change in  value of a                         fixed number of  issuers equity shares
  or
                
4
        the holder has  option to require   obligation be settled in equity                         shares
 unless eir 
i
 in  case of a traded instrument
  supervisor is                         content   bank has demonstrated   instrument trades more                         like  debt of  issuer than like its equity
 or 
ii
 in  case of non
                        traded instruments
  supervisor is content   bank has                         demonstrated   instrument should be treated as a debt position
 in cases  
i
 and 
ii
""
  bank may decompose  risks for regulatory                        purposes
 with  consent of  supervisor
          indirect equity interests include holdings of derivative instruments tied to equity interests
  and holdings in       corporations
 partnerships
 limited liability companies or or types of enterprises   issue ownership       interests and are engaged principally in  business of investing in equity instruments
  where some member countries retain ir existing treatment as an exception to   deduction approach
       such equity investments by irb banks are to be considered eligible for inclusion in ir irb  equity portfolios
  for certain obligations  require or permit settlement by issuance of a variable number of   issuers equity       shares
  change in  monetary value of  obligation is equal to  change in  fair  value of a fixed       number of equity shares multiplied by a specified factor
 those obligations meet   conditions of item 3 if       both  factor and  referenced number of shares are fixed
 for example
 an issuer may  be required to       settle an obligation by issuing shares with a value equal to three times  appreciation in   fair value of       1
000 equity shares
 that obligation is considered to be  same as an obligation   requires settlement by       issuance of shares equal to  appreciation in  fair value of 3
000 equity shares
                            237
      debt obligations and or securities
 partnerships
 derivatives or or vehicles  structured with  intent of conveying  economic substance of equity ownership are  considered an equity holding
 this includes liabilities from which  return is linked to   of equities
 conversely
 equity investments  are structured with  intent of conveying   economic substance of debt holdings or securitisation exposures would not be  considered an equity holding
    238
     the national supervisor has  discretion to re-characterise debt holdings as  equities for regulatory purposes and to orwise ensure  proper treatment of holdings  under pillar 2
    
vii
       definition of eligible purchased receivables  239
     eligible purchased receivables are divided into retail and corporate receivables as  defined below
    retail receivables  240
     purchased retail receivables
 provided  purchasing bank complies with  irb  rules for retail exposures
 are eligible for  top-down approach as permitted within   existing standards for retail exposures
 the bank must also apply  minimum operational  requirements as set forth in sections iii
f and iii
h
    corporate receivables  241
      in general
 for purchased corporate receivables
 banks are expected to assess   default risk of individual obligors as specified in section iii
c
1 
starting with paragraph 271
  consistent with  treatment of or corporate exposures
 however
  top-down  approach  may be used
 provided   purchasing banks programme for corporate receivables  complies with both  criteria for eligible receivables and  minimum operational  requirements of this approach
 the use of  top-down purchased receivables treatment is  limited to situations where it would be an undue burden on a bank to be subjected to   minimum requirements for  irb approach to corporate exposures  would orwise  apply
 primarily
 it is intended for receivables  are purchased for inclusion in asset
 backed securitisation structures
 but banks may also use this approach
 with  approval of  national supervisors
 for appropriate on-balance sheet exposures  share  same  features
    242
      supervisors may deny  use of  top-down approach for purchased corporate  receivables depending on  banks compliance with minimum requirements
 in particular
  to be eligible for  proposed top-down treatment
 purchased corporate receivables must  satisfy  following conditions
"        equities  are recorded as a loan but arise from a debt/equity swap made as part of   orderly realisation       or restructuring of  debt are included in  definition of equity holdings"
 however
  se instruments may       not attract a lower capital charge than would apply if  holdings remained in  debt  portfolio
  supervisors may decide not to require  such liabilities be included where y are directly  hedged by an       equity holding
 such   net position does not involve material risk
  the receivables are purchased from unrelated
 third party sellers
 and as such              bank has not originated  receivables eir directly or indirectly
  the receivables must be generated on an arms-length basis between  seller and              obligor
 
as such
 intercompany accounts receivable and receivables subject to             contra-accounts between firms  buy and sell to each or are ineligible
 
  the purchasing bank has a claim on all proceeds from  pool of receivables or a             pro-rata interest in  proceeds
   national supervisors must also establish concentration limits above which capital             charges must be calculated using  minimum requirements for  bottom-up             approach for corporate exposures
 such concentration limits may refer to one or a             combination of  following measures
  size of one individual exposure relative             to  total pool
  size of  pool of receivables as a percentage of regulatory             capital
 or  maximum size of an individual exposure in  pool
  243
      the existence of full or partial recourse to  seller does not automatically disqualify  a bank from adopting this top-down approach
 as long as  cash flows from  purchased  corporate receivables are  primary protection against default risk as determined by   rules in paragraphs 365 to 368 for purchased receivables and  bank meets  eligibility  criteria and operational requirements
    2
         foundation and advanced approaches  244
    for each of  asset classes covered under  irb framework
 re are three key  elements
    risk components  estimates of risk parameters provided by banks some of which             are supervisory estimates
  risk-weight functions   means by which risk components are transformed into             risk-weighted assets and refore capital requirements
  minimum requirements   minimum standards  must be met in order for a             bank to use  irb approach for a given asset class
  245
       for many of  asset classes
  committee has made available two broad  approaches
 a foundation and an advanced
 under  foundation approach
 as a general  rule
 banks provide ir own estimates of pd and rely on supervisory estimates for or risk  components
 under  advanced approach
 banks provide more of ir own estimates of  pd
 lgd and ead
 and ir own calculation of m
 subject to meeting minimum standards
  for both  foundation and advanced approaches
 banks must always use  risk-weight  functions provided in this framework for  purpose of deriving capital requirements
 the  full suite of approaches is described below
          contra-accounts involve a customer buying from and selling to  same firm
 the risk is   debts may be       settled through payments in kind rar than cash
 invoices between  companies may  be offset against       each or instead of being paid
 this practice can defeat a security interest when  challenged in court
  claims on tranches of  proceeds 
first loss position
 second loss position
 etc
""
 would fall  under        securitisation treatment
  
i
           corporate
 sovereign
 and bank exposures  246
     under  foundation approach
 banks must provide ir own estimates of pd  associated with each of ir borrower grades
 but must use supervisory estimates for   or relevant risk components
 the or risk components are lgd
 ead and m
     247
    under  advanced approach
 banks must calculate  effective maturity 
m
   and provide ir own estimates of pd
 lgd and ead
    248
          there is an exception to this general rule for  five sub-classes of assets identified  as sl
    the sl categories
 pf
 of
 cf
 ipre
 and hvcre  249
     banks  do not meet  requirements for  estimation of pd under   corporate foundation approach for ir sl assets are required to map ir internal risk  grades to five supervisory categories
 each of which is associated with a specific risk weight
  this version is termed  supervisory slotting criteria approach
    250
     banks  meet  requirements for  estimation of pd are able to use   foundation approach to corporate exposures to derive risk weights for all classes of sl  exposures except hvcre
 at national discretion
 banks meeting  requirements for  hvcre exposure are able to use a foundation approach  is similar in all respects to   corporate approach
 with  exception of a separate risk-weight function as described in  paragraph 283
    251
     banks  meet  requirements for  estimation of pd
 lgd and ead are able  to use  advanced approach to corporate exposures to derive risk weights for all classes of  sl exposures except hvcre
 at national discretion
 banks meeting se requirements for  hvcre exposure are able to use an advanced approach  is similar in all respects to   corporate approach
 with  exception of a separate risk-weight function as described in  paragraph 283
    
ii
          retail exposures  252
     for retail exposures
 banks must provide ir own estimates of pd
 lgd and ead
  there is no distinction between a foundation and advanced approach for this asset class
    
iii
         equity exposures  253
    there are two broad approaches to calculate risk-weighted assets for equity  exposures not held in  trading book
" a market-based approach and a pd/lgd approach"
  these are set out in full in paragraphs 340 to 361
    254
"    the pd/lgd approach to equity exposures remains available for banks  adopt   advanced approach for or exposure types"
          as noted in paragraph 318
 some supervisors may require banks using  foundation  approach to calculate         m using  definition provided in paragraphs 320 to 324
  at  discretion of  national supervisor
 certain domestic exposures may be exempt from   calculation of         m 
see paragraph 319
""
  
iv
     eligible purchased receivables  255
     the treatment potentially straddles two asset classes
 for eligible corporate  receivables
 both a foundation and advanced approach are available subject to certain  operational requirements being met
 for eligible retail receivables
 as with  retail asset  class
 re is no distinction between a foundation and advanced approach
      3
       adoption of  irb approach across asset classes  256
     once a bank adopts an irb approach for part of its holdings
 it is expected to extend  it across  entire banking group
 the committee recognises however
 
 for many  banks
 it may not be practicable for various reasons to implement  irb approach across  all material asset classes and business units at  same time
 furrmore
 once on irb
"  data limitations may mean  banks can meet  standards for  use of own estimates of  lgd and ead for some but not all of ir asset classes/business units at  same time"
    257
    as such
 supervisors may allow banks to adopt a phased rollout of  irb approach  across  banking group
 the phased rollout includes 
i
 adoption of irb across asset  classes within  same business unit 
or in  case of retail exposures across individual  sub-classes
""
 
ii
 adoption of irb across business units in  same banking group
 and 
iii
  move from  foundation approach to  advanced approach for certain risk components
  however
 when a bank adopts an irb approach for an asset class within a particular  business unit 
or in  case of retail exposures for an individual sub-class
""
 it must apply   irb approach to all exposures within  asset class 
or sub-class
 in  unit
    258
      a bank must produce an implementation plan
 specifying to what extent and when it  intends to roll out irb approaches across significant asset classes 
or sub-classes in   case of retail
 and business units over time
 the plan should be exacting
 yet realistic
 and  must be agreed with  supervisor
 it should be driven by  practicality and feasibility of  moving to  more advanced approaches
 and not motivated by a desire to adopt a pillar 1  approach  minimises its capital charge
 during  roll-out period
 supervisors will ensure   no capital relief is granted for intra-group transactions which are designed to reduce a  banking groups aggregate capital charge by transferring credit risk among entities on   standardised approach
 foundation and advanced irb approaches
 this includes
 but is not  limited to
 asset sales or cross guarantees
    259
     some exposures in non-significant business units as well as asset classes 
or sub
 classes in  case of retail
  are immaterial in terms of size and perceived risk profile  may be exempt from  requirements in  previous two paragraphs
 subject to supervisory  approval
 capital requirements for such operations will be determined according to   standardised approach
 with  national supervisor determining wher a bank should hold  more capital under pillar 2 for such positions
    260
     notwithstanding  above
 once a bank has adopted  irb approach for all or  part of any of  corporate
 bank
 sovereign
 or retail asset classes
 it will be required to  adopt  irb approach for its equity exposures at  same time
 subject to materiality
  supervisors may require a bank to employ one of  irb equity approaches if its equity  exposures are a significant part of  banks business
 even though  bank may not  employ an irb approach in or business lines
 furr
 once a bank has adopted   general irb approach for corporate exposures
 it will be required to adopt  irb approach  for  sl sub-classes within  corporate exposure class
    261
   banks adopting an irb approach are expected to continue to employ an irb  approach
 a voluntary return to  standardised or foundation approach is permitted only in  extraordinary circumstances
 such as divestiture of a large fraction of  banks credit
 related business
 and must be approved by  supervisor
    262
    given  data limitations associated with sl exposures
 a bank may remain on   supervisory slotting criteria approach for one or more of  pf
 of
 cf
 ipre or hvcre  sub-classes
 and move to  foundation or advanced approach for or sub-classes within   corporate asset class
 however
 a bank should not move to  advanced approach for   hvcre sub-class without also doing so for material ipre exposures at  same time

       transition arrangements  
i
      parallel calculation  263
     banks adopting  foundation or advanced approaches are required to calculate  ir capital requirement using se approaches
 as well as  1988 accord for  time  period specified in paragraphs 45 to 49
 parallel calculation for banks adopting   foundation irb approach to credit risk will start for  year beginning year-end 2005
" banks  moving directly from  1988 accord to  advanced approaches to credit and/or  operational risk will be subject to parallel calculations or impact studies for  year beginning  year-end 2005 and to parallel calculations for  year beginning year-end 2006"

"  the applicable aforementioned transitional arrangements also apply to  pd/lgd           approach to equity"
 there are no transitional arrangements for  market-based           approach to equity
  265
     under se transitional arrangements banks are required to have a minimum of two  years of data at  implementation of this framework
 this requirement will increase by one  year for each of three years of transition
    266
    owing to  potential for very long-run cycles in house prices which short-term data  may not adequately capture
 during this transition period
 lgds for retail exposures secured  by residential properties cannot be set below 10% for any sub-segment of exposures to  which  formula in paragraph 328 is applied
 during  transition period  committee  will review  potential need for continuation of this floor
    
iii
        equity exposures  267
     for a maximum of ten years
 supervisors may exempt from  irb treatment  particular equity investments held at  time of  publication of this framework
  the  exempted position is measured as  number of shares as of  date and any additional  arising directly as a result of owning those holdings
 as long as y do not increase   proportional share of ownership in a portfolio company

 due to a change of ownership initiated by  investing company subsequent to   publication of this framework
  exceeding part of  holding is not subject to   exemption
 nor will  exemption apply to holdings  were originally subject to   exemption
 but have been sold and n bought back

      banks  do not meet  requirements for estimation of pd
 or whose supervisor  has chosen not to implement  foundation or advanced approaches to hvcre
 must map  ir internal grades to five supervisory categories
 each of which is associated with a  specific risk weight
 the slotting criteria on which this mapping must be based are  same  as those for ipre

    treatment of guarantees and credit derivatives  300
     there are two approaches for recognition of crm in  form of guarantees and  credit derivatives in  irb approach
 a foundation approach for banks using supervisory  values of lgd
 and an advanced approach for those banks using ir own internal  estimates of lgd
    301
     under eir approach
 crm in  form of guarantees and credit derivatives must  not reflect  effect of double default 
see paragraph 482
""
 as such
 to  extent    crm is recognised by  bank
  adjusted risk weight will not be less than  of a  comparable direct exposure to  protection provider
 consistent with  standardised  approach
 banks may choose not to recognise credit protection if doing so would result in a  higher capital requirement
    recognition under  foundation approach  302
     for banks using  foundation approach for lgd
  approach to guarantees and  credit derivatives closely follows  treatment under  standardised approach as specified  in paragraphs 189 to 201
 the range of eligible guarantors is  same as under   standardised approach except  companies  are internally rated and associated with a  pd equivalent to a
or better may also be recognised under  foundation approach
 to  receive recognition
  requirements outlined in paragraphs 189 to 194 must be met
  303
        eligible guarantees from eligible guarantors will be recognised as follows
    for  covered portion of  exposure
 a risk weight is derived by taking
                        risk-weight function appropriate to  type of guarantor
 and                       pd appropriate to  guarantors borrower grade

  the bank may replace  lgd of  underlying transaction with  lgd              applicable to  guarantee taking into account seniority and any collateralisation of              a guaranteed commitment
  304
    the uncovered portion of  exposure is assigned  risk weight associated with   underlying obligor
    305
     where partial coverage exists
 or where re is a currency mismatch between   underlying obligation and  credit protection
 it is necessary to split  exposure into a  covered and an uncovered amount
 the treatment in  foundation approach follows   outlined in  standardised approach in paragraphs 198 to 200
 and depends upon wher   cover is proportional or tranched
    recognition under  advanced approach  306
     banks using  advanced approach for estimating lgds may reflect  risk
 mitigating effect of guarantees and credit derivatives through eir adjusting pd or lgd  estimates
 wher adjustments are done through pd or lgd
 y must be done in a  consistent manner for a given guarantee or credit derivative type
 in doing so
 banks must  not include  effect of double default in such adjustments
 thus
  adjusted risk weight  must not be less than  of a comparable direct exposure to  protection provider
    307
     a bank relying on own-estimates of lgd has  option to adopt  treatment  outlined above for banks under  foundation irb approach

ii
 any specific provisions  and partial write-offs

 a ccf of 0% will be applied to se facilities

       the amount to which  ccf is applied is  lower of  value of  unused  committed credit line
 and  value  reflects any possible constraining availability of   facility
 such as  existence of a ceiling on  potential lending amount which is related to  a borrowers reported cash flow
 if  facility is constrained in this way
  bank must have  sufficient line monitoring and management procedures to support this contention
    314
     in order to apply a 0% ccf for unconditionally and immediately cancellable  corporate overdrafts and or facilities
 banks must demonstrate  y actively monitor   financial condition of  borrower

     risk-weighted assets for equity exposures in  trading book are subject to   market risk capital rules
    341
      there are two approaches to calculate risk-weighted assets for equity exposures not  held in  trading book
" a market-based approach and a pd/lgd approach"
 supervisors will  decide which approach or approaches will be used by banks
 and in what circumstances
  certain equity holdings are excluded as defined in paragraphs 356 to 358 and are subject to   capital charges required under  standardised approach
    342
    where supervisors permit both methodologies
 banks choices must be made  consistently
 and in particular not determined by regulatory arbitrage considerations
    
i
     market-based approach  343
      under  market-based approach
 institutions are permitted to calculate   minimum capital requirements for ir banking book equity holdings using one or both of  two  separate and distinct methods
 a simple risk weight method or an internal models method
  the method used should be consistent with  amount and complexity of  institutions  equity holdings and commensurate with  overall size and sophistication of  institution
  supervisors may require  use of eir method based on  individual circumstances of  an institution
    simple risk weight method  344
     under  simple risk weight method
 a 300% risk weight is to be applied to equity  holdings  are publicly traded and a 400% risk weight is to be applied to all or equity  holdings
 a publicly traded holding is defined as any equity security traded on a recognised  security exchange
    345
      short cash positions and derivative instruments held in  banking book are  permitted to offset long positions in  same individual stocks provided  se  instruments have been explicitly designated as hedges of specific equity holdings and   y have remaining maturities of at least one year
 or short positions are to be treated as  if y are long positions with  relevant risk weight applied to  absolute value of each  position
 in  context of maturity mismatched positions
  methodology is  for  corporate exposures
  internal models method  346
      irb banks may use
 or may be required by ir supervisor to use
 internal risk  measurement models to calculate  risk-based capital requirement
 under this alternative
  banks must hold capital equal to  potential loss on  institutions equity holdings as  derived using internal value-at-risk models subject to  99th percentile
 one-tailed  confidence interval of  difference between quarterly returns and an appropriate risk-free  rate computed over a long-term sample period
 the capital charge would be incorporated  into an institutions risk-based capital ratio through  calculation of risk-weighted equivalent  assets
    347
      the risk weight used to convert holdings into risk-weighted equivalent assets would  be calculated by multiplying  derived capital charge by 12

 capital charges calculated under  internal  models method may be no less than  capital charges  would be calculated under   simple risk weight method using a 200% risk weight for publicly traded equity holdings and a  300% risk weight for all or equity holdings

 are   same as those for  irb foundation approach for corporate exposures subject to   following specifications
     the banks estimate of  pd of a corporate entity in which it holds an equity                position must satisfy  same requirements as  banks estimate of  pd of a                corporate entity where  bank holds debt
 if a bank does not hold debt of                 company in whose equity it has invested
 and does not have sufficient information                on  position of  company to be able to use  applicable definition of default                in practice but meets  or standards

 however
"  banks equity holdings are material and it is permitted to use a                pd/lgd approach for regulatory purposes but  bank has not yet met  relevant                standards"
  simple risk-weight method under  market-based approach will                apply
       there is no advanced approach for equity exposures
 given  90% lgd assumption
  in practice
 if re is both an equity exposure and an irb credit exposure to  same  counterparty
 a default         on  credit exposure would thus trigger a simultaneous default for regulatory purposes  on  equity         exposure
  an lgd of 90% would be assumed in deriving  risk weight for equity exposures
  for se purposes
  risk weight is subject to a five-year maturity adjustment           wher or not  bank is using  explicit approach to maturity elsewhere in its           irb portfolio
  351
"     under  pd/lgd approach"

 when  sum of ul and el associated with  equity exposure results in  less capital than would be required from application of one of  minimum risk weights
   minimum risk weights must be used
 in or words
  minimum risk weights must be  applied
 if  risk weights calculated according to paragraph 350 plus  el associated with   equity exposure multiplied by 12

"     the maximum risk weight for  pd/lgd approach for equity exposures is 1250%"
  this maximum risk weight can be applied

including those publicly sponsored entities where a zero risk weight can be applied
""
 at   discretion of  national supervisor
 if a national supervisor makes such an exclusion this  will be available to all banks

     to promote specified sectors of  economy
 supervisors may exclude from   irb capital charges equity holdings made under legislated programmes  provide  significant subsidies for  investment to  bank and involve some form of government  oversight and restrictions on  equity investments
 example of restrictions are limitations  on  size and types of businesses in which  bank is investing
 allowable amounts of  ownership interests
 geographical location and or pertinent factors  limit  potential  risk of  investment to  bank
 equity holdings made under legislated programmes can  only be excluded from  irb approaches up to an aggregate of 10% of tier 1 plus tier 2  capital
    358
      supervisors may also exclude  equity exposures of a bank from  irb  treatment based on materiality
 the equity exposures of a bank are considered material if  ir aggregate value
 excluding all legislative programmes discussed in paragraph 357
  exceeds
 on average over  prior year
 10% of bank  tier 1 plus tier 2 capital
 this  materiality threshold is lowered to 5% of a bank  tier 1 plus tier 2 capital if  equity  portfolio consists of less than 10 individual holdings
 national supervisors may use lower  materiality thresholds

          risk components  359
    in general
  measure of an equity exposure on which capital requirements is  based is  value presented in  financial statements
 which depending on national  accounting and regulatory practices may include unrealised revaluation gains
 thus
 for  example
 equity exposure measures will be
    for investments held at fair value with changes in value flowing directly through              income and into regulatory capital
 exposure is equal to  fair value presented in               balance sheet
  for investments held at fair value with changes in value not flowing through income              but into a tax-adjusted separate component of equity
 exposure is equal to  fair              value presented in  balance sheet
  for investments held at cost or at  lower of cost or market
 exposure is equal to               cost or market value presented in  balance sheet
   360
     holdings in funds containing both equity investments and or non-equity types of  investments can be eir treated
 in a consistent manner
 as a single investment based on   majority of  funds holdings or
 where possible
 as separate and distinct investments in   funds component holdings based on a look-through approach
    361
     where only  investment mandate of  fund is known
  fund can still be  treated as a single investment
 for this purpose
 it is assumed   fund first invests
 to   maximum extent allowed under its mandate
 in  asset classes attracting  highest  capital requirement
 and n continues making investments in descending order until   maximum total investment level is reached
 the same approach can also be used for   look-through approach

       composition of minimum requirements  388
      to be eligible for  irb approach a bank must demonstrate to its supervisor  it  meets certain minimum requirements at  outset and on an ongoing basis
 many of se  requirements are in  form of objectives  a qualifying banks risk rating systems must  fulfil
 the focus is on banks abilities to rank order and quantify risk in a consistent
 reliable  and valid fashion
    389
      the overarching principle behind se requirements is  rating and risk  estimation systems and processes provide for a meaningful assessment of borrower and  transaction characteristics
 a meaningful differentiation of risk
 and reasonably accurate and  consistent quantitative estimates of risk
 furrmore
  systems and processes must be  consistent with internal use of se estimates
 the committee recognises  differences in  markets
 rating methodologies
 banking products
 and practices require banks and  supervisors to customise ir operational procedures
 it is not  committees intention to  dictate  form or operational detail of banks risk management policies and practices
 each  supervisor will develop detailed review procedures to ensure  banks systems and  controls are adequate to serve as  basis for  irb approach

 all irb banks must produce ir  own estimates of pd  and must adhere to  overall requirements for rating system design
  operations
 controls
 and corporate governance
 as well as  requisite requirements for  estimation and validation of pd measures
 banks wishing to use ir own estimates of lgd  and ead must also meet  incremental minimum requirements for se risk factors  included in paragraphs 468 to 489

 a bank must demonstrate to its supervisor  it  meets  irb requirements in this document
 at  outset and on an ongoing basis
 banks  overall credit risk management practices must also be consistent with  evolving sound  practice guidelines issued by  committee and national supervisors
    393
      there may be circumstances when a bank is not in complete compliance with all   minimum requirements
 where this is  case
  bank must produce a plan for a timely  return to compliance
 and seek approval from its supervisor
 or  bank must demonstrate    effect of such non-compliance is immaterial in terms of  risk posed to   institution
 failure to produce an acceptable plan or satisfactorily implement  plan or to  demonstrate immateriality will lead supervisors to reconsider  banks eligibility for  irb  approach

i
         rating dimensions  standards for corporate
 sovereign
 and bank exposures  396
       a qualifying irb rating system must have two separate and distinct dimensions
  
i
  risk of borrower default
 and 
ii
 transaction-specific factors
    397
     the first dimension must be oriented to  risk of borrower default
 separate  exposures to  same borrower must be assigned to  same borrower grade
 irrespective  of any differences in  nature of each specific transaction
 there are two exceptions to this
        banks are not required to produce ir own estimates of pd for certain equity exposures and  certain        exposures  fall within  sl sub-class
  firstly
 in  case of country transfer risk
 where a bank may assign different borrower  grades depending on wher  facility is denominated in local or foreign currency
  secondly
 when  treatment of associated guarantees to a facility may be reflected in an  adjusted borrower grade
 in eir case
 separate exposures may result in multiple grades for   same borrower
 a bank must articulate in its credit policy  relationship between  borrower grades in terms of  level of risk each grade implies
 perceived and measured  risk must increase as credit quality declines from one grade to  next
 the policy must  articulate  risk of each grade in terms of both a description of  probability of default risk  typical for borrowers assigned  grade and  criteria used to distinguish  level of  credit risk
    398
      the second dimension must reflect transaction-specific factors
 such as collateral
  seniority
 product type
 etc
 for foundation irb banks
 this requirement can be fulfilled by   existence of a facility dimension
 which reflects both borrower and transaction-specific  factors
 for example
 a rating dimension  reflects el by incorporating both borrower  strength 
pd
 and loss severity 
lgd
 considerations would qualify
 likewise a rating system   exclusively reflects lgd would qualify
 where a rating dimension reflects el and does  not separately quantify lgd
  supervisory estimates of lgd must be used
    399
      for banks using  advanced approach
 facility ratings must reflect exclusively  lgd
 these ratings can reflect any and all factors  can influence lgd including
 but not  limited to
  type of collateral
 product
 industry
 and purpose
 borrower characteristics may  be included as lgd rating criteria only to  extent y are predictive of lgd
 banks may  alter  factors  influence facility grades across segments of  portfolio as long as y  can satisfy ir supervisor  it improves  relevance and precision of ir estimates
    400
     banks using  supervisory slotting criteria for  sl sub-class are exempt from  this two-dimensional requirement for se exposures
" given  interdependence between  borrower/transaction characteristics in sl"
 banks may satisfy  requirements under this  heading through a single rating dimension  reflects el by incorporating both borrower  strength 
pd
 and loss severity 
lgd
 considerations
 this exemption does not apply to  banks using eir  general corporate foundation or advanced approach for  sl sub
 class
    standards for retail exposures  401
      rating systems for retail exposures must be oriented to both borrower and  transaction risk
 and must capture all relevant borrower and transaction characteristics
  banks must assign each exposure  falls within  definition of retail for irb purposes  into a particular pool
 banks must demonstrate  this process provides for a meaningful  differentiation of risk
 provides for a grouping of sufficiently homogenous exposures
 and  allows for accurate and consistent estimation of loss characteristics at pool level
    402
      for each pool
 banks must estimate pd
 lgd
 and ead
 multiple pools may share  identical pd
 lgd and ead estimates
 at a minimum
 banks should consider  following  risk drivers when assigning exposures to a pool
    borrower risk characteristics 
""
 borrower type
" demographics such as           age/occupation"
""
  transaction risk characteristics
" including product and/or collateral types "
""
 loan           to value measures
 seasoning
 guarantees
 and seniority

 banks are expected to separately identify exposures            are delinquent and those  are not
  
ii
     rating structure  standards for corporate
 sovereign
 and bank exposures  403
    a bank must have a meaningful distribution of exposures across grades with no  excessive concentrations
 on both its borrower-rating and its facility-rating scales
    404
      to meet this objective
 a bank must have a minimum of seven borrower grades for  non-defaulted borrowers and one for those  have defaulted
 banks with lending activities  focused on a particular market segment may satisfy this requirement with  minimum  number of grades
 supervisors may require banks
 which lend to borrowers of diverse credit  quality
 to have a greater number of borrower grades
    405
      a borrower grade is defined as an assessment of borrower risk on  basis of a  specified and distinct set of rating criteria
 from which estimates of pd are derived
 the grade  definition must include both a description of  degree of default risk typical for borrowers  assigned  grade and  criteria used to distinguish  level of credit risk
 furrmore
  
 or 
modifiers to alpha or numeric grades will only qualify as distinct grades if  bank  has developed complete rating descriptions and criteria for ir assignment
 and separately  quantifies pds for se modified grades
    406
     banks with loan portfolios concentrated in a particular market segment and range of  default risk must have enough grades within  range to avoid undue concentrations of  borrowers in particular grades
 significant concentrations within a single grade or grades  must be supported by convincing empirical evidence   grade or grades cover  reasonably narrow pd bands and   default risk posed by all borrowers in a grade fall  within  band
    407
     there is no specific minimum number of facility grades for banks using   advanced approach for estimating lgd
 a bank must have a sufficient number of facility  grades to avoid grouping facilities with widely varying lgds into a single grade
 the criteria  used to define facility grades must be grounded in empirical evidence
    408
    banks using  supervisory slotting criteria for  sl asset classes must have at  least four grades for non-defaulted borrowers
 and one for defaulted borrowers
 the  requirements for sl exposures  qualify for  corporate foundation and advanced  approaches are  same as those for general corporate exposures
    standards for retail exposures  409
     for each pool identified
  bank must be able to provide quantitative measures of  loss characteristics 
pd
 lgd
 and ead
 for  pool
 the level of differentiation for irb  purposes must ensure   number of exposures in a given pool is sufficient so as to  allow for meaningful quantification and validation of  loss characteristics at  pool level
  there must be a meaningful distribution of borrowers and exposures across pools
 a single  pool must not include an undue concentration of  banks total retail exposure
    
iii
    rating criteria  410
     a bank must have specific rating definitions
 processes and criteria for assigning  exposures to grades within a rating system
 the rating definitions and criteria must be both  plausible and intuitive and must result in a meaningful differentiation of risk
    the grade descriptions and criteria must be sufficiently detailed to allow those           charged with assigning ratings to consistently assign  same grade to borrowers           or facilities posing similar risk
 this consistency should exist across lines of  written rating definitions must be clear and detailed enough to allow third parties to           understand  assignment of ratings
 such as internal audit or an equally           independent function and supervisors
" to replicate rating assignments and evaluate            appropriateness of  grade/pool assignments"
  the criteria must also be consistent with  banks internal lending standards and           its policies for handling troubled borrowers and facilities
  411
     to ensure  banks are consistently taking into account available information
 y  must use all relevant and material information in assigning ratings to borrowers and facilities
  information must be current
 the less information a bank has
  more conservative must be  its assignments of exposures to borrower and facility grades or pools
 an external rating can  be  primary factor determining an internal rating assignment
 however
  bank must  ensure  it considers or relevant information
    sl product lines within  corporate asset class  412
      banks using  supervisory slotting criteria for sl exposures must assign  exposures to ir internal rating grades based on ir own criteria
 systems and processes
  subject to compliance with  requisite minimum requirements
 banks must n map se  internal rating grades into  five supervisory rating categories
 tables 1 to 4 in annex 4  provide
 for each sub-class of sl exposures
  general assessment factors and  characteristics exhibited by  exposures  fall under each of  supervisory categories
  each lending activity has a unique table describing  assessment factors and  characteristics
    413
      the committee recognises   criteria  banks use to assign exposures to  internal grades will not perfectly align with criteria  define  supervisory categories
  however
 banks must demonstrate  ir mapping process has resulted in an alignment  of grades which is consistent with  preponderance of  characteristics in  respective  supervisory category
 banks should take special care to ensure  any overrides of ir  internal criteria do not render  mapping process ineffective
    
iv
     rating assignment horizon  414
    although  time horizon used in pd estimation is one year 
as described in  paragraph 447
""
 banks are expected to use a longer time horizon in assigning ratings
    415
      a borrower rating must represent  banks assessment of  borrowers ability  and willingness to contractually perform despite adverse economic conditions or   occurrence of unexpected events
 for example
 a bank may base rating assignments on  specific
 appropriate stress scenarios
 alternatively
 a bank may take into account borrower  characteristics  are reflective of  borrowers vulnerability to adverse economic  conditions or unexpected events
 without explicitly specifying a stress scenario
" the range of  economic conditions  are considered when making assessments must be consistent with  current conditions and those  are likely to occur over a business cycle within   respective industry/geographic region"
    416
      given  difficulties in forecasting future events and  influence y will have on  a particular borrowers financial condition
 a bank must take a conservative view of projected  information
 furrmore
 where limited data are available
 a bank must adopt a conservative  bias to its analysis
  
v
      use of models  417
     the requirements in this section apply to statistical models and or mechanical  methods used to assign borrower or facility ratings or in estimation of pds
 lgds
 or eads
  credit scoring models and or mechanical rating procedures generally use only a subset of  available information
 although mechanical rating procedures may sometimes avoid some of   idiosyncratic errors made by rating systems in which human judgement plays a large  role
 mechanical use of limited information also is a source of rating errors
 credit scoring  models and or mechanical procedures are permissible as  primary or partial basis of  rating assignments
 and may play a role in  estimation of loss characteristics
 sufficient  human judgement and human oversight is necessary to ensure  all relevant and material  information
 including  which is outside  scope of  model
 is also taken into  consideration
 and   model is used appropriately
    the burden is on  bank to satisfy its supervisor  a model or procedure has           good predictive power and  regulatory capital requirements will not be distorted           as a result of its use
 the variables  are input to  model must form a           reasonable set of predictors
 the model must be accurate on average across            range of borrowers or facilities to which  bank is exposed and re must be no           known material biases
  the bank must have in place a process for vetting data inputs into a statistical           default or loss prediction model which includes an assessment of  accuracy
           completeness and appropriateness of  data specific to  assignment of an           approved rating
  the bank must demonstrate   data used to build  model are representative           of  population of  banks actual borrowers or facilities
  when combining model results with human judgement
  judgement must take           into account all relevant and material information not considered by  model
 the           bank must have written guidance describing how human judgement and model           results are to be combined
  the bank must have procedures for human review of model-based rating           assignments
 such procedures should focus on finding and limiting errors           associated with known model weaknesses and must also include credible ongoing           efforts to improve  models performance
  the bank must have a regular cycle of model validation  includes monitoring of           model performance and stability
 review of model relationships
 and testing of model           outputs against outcomes
    
vi
     documentation of rating system design  418
     banks must document in writing ir rating systems design and operational details
  the documentation must evidence banks compliance with  minimum standards
 and must  address topics such as portfolio differentiation
 rating criteria
 responsibilities of parties   rate borrowers and facilities
 definition of what constitutes a rating exception
 parties   have authority to approve exceptions
 frequency of rating reviews
 and management  oversight of  rating process
 a bank must document  rationale for its choice of internal  rating criteria and must be able to provide analyses demonstrating  rating criteria and  procedures are likely to result in ratings  meaningfully differentiate risk
 rating criteria  and procedures must be periodically reviewed to determine wher y remain fully  applicable to  current portfolio and to external conditions
 in addition
 a bank must  document a history of major changes in  risk rating process
 and such documentation  must support identification of changes made to  risk rating process subsequent to  last  supervisory review
 the organisation of rating assignment
 including  internal control  structure
 must also be documented
    419
   banks must document  specific definitions of default and loss used internally and  demonstrate consistency with  reference definitions set out in paragraphs 452 to 460
    420
     if  bank employs statistical models in  rating process
  bank must document  ir methodologies

     use of a model obtained from a third-party vendor  claims proprietary technology  is not a justification for exemption from documentation or any or of  requirements for  internal rating systems
 the burden is on  models vendor and  bank to satisfy  supervisors
      4
      risk rating system operations  
i
     coverage of ratings  422
     for corporate
 sovereign
 and bank exposures
 each borrower and all recognised  guarantors must be assigned a rating and each exposure must be associated with a facility  rating as part of  loan approval process
 similarly
 for retail
 each exposure must be  assigned to a pool as part of  loan approval process
    423
      each separate legal entity to which  bank is exposed must be separately rated
 a  bank must have policies acceptable to its supervisor regarding  treatment of individual  entities in a connected group including circumstances under which  same rating may or  may not be assigned to some or all related entities
    
ii
    integrity of rating process  standards for corporate
 sovereign
 and bank exposures  424
     rating assignments and periodic rating reviews must be completed or approved by  a party  does not directly stand to benefit from  extension of credit
 independence of   rating assignment process can be achieved through a range of practices  will be  carefully reviewed by supervisors
 these operational processes must be documented in   banks procedures and incorporated into bank policies
 credit policies and underwriting  procedures must reinforce and foster  independence of  rating process
    425
     borrowers and facilities must have ir ratings refreshed at least on an annual  basis
 certain credits
 especially higher risk borrowers or problem exposures
 must be  subject to more frequent review
 in addition
 banks must initiate a new rating if material  information on  borrower or facility comes to light
    426
     the bank must have an effective process to obtain and update relevant and material  information on  borrowers financial condition
 and on facility characteristics  affect  lgds and eads 
such as  condition of collateral
""
 upon receipt
  bank needs to have a  procedure to update  borrowers rating in a timely fashion
  standards for retail exposures  427
      a bank must review  loss characteristics and delinquency status of each  identified risk pool on at least an annual basis
 it must also review  status of individual  borrowers within each pool as a means of ensuring  exposures continue to be assigned  to  correct pool
 this requirement may be satisfied by review of a representative sample  of exposures in  pool
    
iii
   overrides  428
     for rating assignments based on expert judgement
 banks must clearly articulate   situations in which bank officers may override  outputs of  rating process
 including  how and to what extent such overrides can be used and by whom
 for model-based ratings
   bank must have guidelines and processes for monitoring cases where human judgement  has overridden  models rating
 variables were excluded or inputs were altered
 these  guidelines must include identifying personnel  are responsible for approving se  overrides
 banks must identify overrides and separately track ir performance
    
iv
    data maintenance  429
     a bank must collect and store data on key borrower and facility characteristics to  provide effective support to its internal credit risk measurement and management process
 to  enable  bank to meet  or requirements in this document
 and to serve as a basis for  supervisory reporting
 these data should be sufficiently detailed to allow retrospective re
 allocation of obligors and facilities to grades
 for example if increasing sophistication of   internal rating system suggests  finer segregation of portfolios can be achieved
  furrmore
 banks must collect and retain data on aspects of ir internal ratings as  required under pillar 3 of this framework
    for corporate
 sovereign
 and bank exposures  430
     banks must maintain rating histories on borrowers and recognised guarantors
"  including  rating since  borrower/guarantor was assigned an internal grade"
  dates   ratings were assigned
"  methodology and key data used to derive  rating and   person/model responsible"
 the identity of borrowers and facilities  default
 and  timing  and circumstances of such defaults
 must be retained
 banks must also retain data on   pds and realised default rates associated with rating grades and ratings migration in order to  track  predictive power of  borrower rating system
    431
"      banks using  advanced irb approach must also collect and store a complete  history of data on  lgd and ead estimates associated with each facility and  key data  used to derive  estimate and  person/model responsible"
 banks must also collect data  on  estimated and realised lgds and eads associated with each defaulted facility
" banks   reflect  credit risk mitigating effects of guarantees/credit derivatives through lgd  must retain data on  lgd of  facility before and after evaluation of  effects of   guarantee/credit derivative"
 information about  components of loss or recovery for each  defaulted exposure must be retained
 such as amounts recovered
 source of recovery 
""
  collateral
 liquidation proceeds and guarantees
""
 time period required for recovery
 and  administrative costs
    432
    banks under  foundation approach which utilise supervisory estimates are  encouraged to retain  relevant data 
i
e
 data on loss and recovery experience for  corporate exposures under  foundation approach
 data on realised losses for banks using   supervisory slotting criteria for sl
""
  for retail exposures  433
     banks must retain data used in  process of allocating exposures to pools
  including data on borrower and transaction risk characteristics used eir directly or through  use of a model
 as well as data on delinquency
 banks must also retain data on   estimated pds
 lgds and eads
 associated with pools of exposures
 for defaulted  exposures
 banks must retain  data on  pools to which  exposure was assigned  over  year prior to default and  realised outcomes on lgd and ead
    
v
      stress tests used in assessment of capital adequacy  434
     an irb bank must have in place sound stress testing processes for use in   assessment of capital adequacy
 stress testing must involve identifying possible events or  future changes in economic conditions  could have unfavourable effects on a banks  credit exposures and assessment of  banks ability to withstand such changes
 examples  of scenarios  could be used are 
i
 economic or industry downturns
 
ii
 market-risk  events
 and 
iii
 liquidity conditions
    435
      in addition to  more general tests described above
  bank must perform a  credit risk stress test to assess  effect of certain specific conditions on its irb regulatory  capital requirements
 the test to be employed would be one chosen by  bank
 subject to  supervisory review
 the test to be employed must be meaningful and reasonably  conservative
 individual banks may develop different approaches to undertaking this stress  test requirement
 depending on ir circumstances
 for this purpose
  objective is not to  require banks to consider worst-case scenarios
 the banks stress test in this context should
  however
 consider at least  effect of mild recession scenarios
 in this case
 one example  might be to use two consecutive quarters of zero growth to assess  effect on  banks  pds
 lgds and eads
 taking account  on a conservative basis  of  banks international  diversification
    436
     whatever method is used
  bank must include a consideration of  following  sources of information
 first
 a banks own data should allow estimation of  ratings  migration of at least some of its exposures
 second
 banks should consider information about   impact of smaller deterioration in  credit environment on a banks ratings
 giving some  information on  likely effect of bigger
 stress circumstances
 third
 banks should evaluate  evidence of ratings migration in external ratings
 this would include  bank broadly  matching its buckets to rating categories
    437
      national supervisors may wish to issue guidance to ir banks on how  tests to  be used for this purpose should be designed
 bearing in mind conditions in ir jurisdiction
  the results of  stress test may indicate no difference in  capital calculated under   irb rules described in this section of this framework if  bank already uses such an  approach for its internal rating purposes
 where a bank operates in several markets
 it does  not need to test for such conditions in all of those markets
 but a bank should stress  portfolios containing  vast majority of its total exposures
  5
            corporate governance and oversight  
i
           corporate governance  438
     all material aspects of  rating and estimation processes must be approved by   banks board of directors or a designated committee reof and senior management
   these parties must possess a general understanding of  banks risk rating system and  detailed comprehension of its associated management reports
 senior management must  provide notice to  board of directors or a designated committee reof of material  changes or exceptions from established policies  will materially impact  operations of   banks rating system
    439
     senior management also must have a good understanding of  rating systems  design and operation
 and must approve material differences between established procedure  and actual practice
 management must also ensure
 on an ongoing basis
   rating  system is operating properly
 management and staff in  credit control function must meet  regularly to discuss  performance of  rating process
 areas needing improvement
 and   status of efforts to improve previously identified deficiencies
    440
      internal ratings must be an essential part of  reporting to se parties
 reporting  must include risk profile by grade
 migration across grades
 estimation of  relevant  parameters per grade
 and comparison of realised default rates 
and lgds and eads for  banks on advanced approaches
 against expectations
 reporting frequencies may vary with   significance and type of information and  level of  recipient
    
ii
          credit risk control  441
     banks must have independent credit risk control units  are responsible for   design or selection
 implementation and performance of ir internal rating systems
 the  unit
s
 must be functionally independent from  personnel and management functions  responsible for originating exposures
 areas of responsibility must include
    testing and monitoring internal grades
  production and analysis of summary reports from  banks rating system
 to                include historical default data sorted by rating at  time of default and one year                prior to default
 grade migration analyses
 and monitoring of trends in key rating                criteria
  implementing procedures to verify  rating definitions are consistently applied                across departments and geographic areas
  reviewing and documenting any changes to  rating process
 including                 reasons for  changes
 and          this standard refers to a management structure composed of a board of directors and senior  management
         the committee is aware  re are significant differences in legislative and regulatory  frameworks across         countries as regards  functions of  board of directors and senior management
 in  some countries
          board has  main
 if not exclusive
 function of supervising  executive body 
senior  management
 general         management
 so as to ensure   latter fulfils its tasks
 for this reason
 in some cases
  it is known as a         supervisory board
 this means   board has no executive functions
 in or  countries
 by contrast
          board has a broader competence in  it lays down  general framework for   management of  bank
         owing to se differences
  notions of  board of directors and senior management  are used in this         paper not to identify legal constructs but rar to label two decision-making functions  within a bank
  reviewing  rating criteria to evaluate if y remain predictive of risk
 changes to               rating process
 criteria or individual rating parameters must be documented and              retained for supervisors to review
  442
    a credit risk control unit must actively participate in  development
 selection
  implementation and validation of rating models
 it must assume oversight and supervision  responsibilities for any models used in  rating process
 and ultimate responsibility for   ongoing review and alterations to rating models
    
iii
       internal and external audit  443
     internal audit or an equally independent function must review at least annually   banks rating system and its operations
 including  operations of  credit function and   estimation of pds
 lgds and eads
 areas of review include adherence to all applicable  minimum requirements
 internal audit must document its findings
 some national supervisors  may also require an external audit of  banks rating assignment process and estimation of  loss characteristics
      6
          use of internal ratings  444
     internal ratings and default and loss estimates must play an essential role in   credit approval
 risk management
 internal capital allocations
 and corporate governance  functions of banks using  irb approach
 ratings systems and estimates designed and  implemented exclusively for  purpose of qualifying for  irb approach and used only to  provide irb inputs are not acceptable
 it is recognised  banks will not necessarily be  using exactly  same estimates for both irb and all internal purposes
 for example
 pricing  models are likely to use pds and lgds relevant to  life of  asset
 where re are such  differences
 a bank must document m and demonstrate ir reasonableness to   supervisor
    445
      a bank must have a credible track record in  use of internal ratings information
  thus
  bank must demonstrate  it has been using a rating system  was broadly in  line with  minimum requirements articulated in this document for at least  three years  prior to qualification
 a bank using  advanced irb approach must demonstrate  it has  been estimating and employing lgds and eads in a manner  is broadly consistent with   minimum requirements for use of own estimates of lgds and eads for at least  three  years prior to qualification
 improvements to a banks rating system will not render a bank  non-compliant with  three-year requirement
    7
          risk quantification  
i
         overall requirements for estimation  structure and intent  446
      this section addresses  broad standards for own-estimates of pd
 lgd
 and  ead
 generally
 all banks using  irb approaches must estimate a pd  for each internal  borrower grade for corporate
 sovereign and bank exposures or for each pool in  case of  retail exposures
          banks are not required to produce ir own estimates of pd for certain equity exposures and  certain        exposures  fall within  sl sub-classes
  447
      pd estimates must be a long-run average of one-year default rates for borrowers in   grade
 with  exception of retail exposures 
see below
""
 requirements specific to pd  estimation are provided in paragraphs 461 to 467
 banks on  advanced approach must  estimate an appropriate lgd 
as defined in paragraphs 468 to 473
 for each of its facilities  
or retail pools
""
 banks on  advanced approach must also estimate an appropriate long
 run default-weighted average ead for each of its facilities as defined in paragraphs 474 and  475
 requirements specific to ead estimation appear in paragraphs 474 to 479
 for  corporate
 sovereign and bank exposures
 banks  do not meet  requirements for own
 estimates of ead or lgd
 above
 must use  supervisory estimates of se parameters
  standards for use of such estimates are set out in paragraphs 506 to 524
    448
     internal estimates of pd
 lgd
 and ead must incorporate all relevant
 material and  available data
 information and methods
 a bank may utilise internal data and data from  external sources 
including pooled data
""
 where internal or external data is used
  bank  must demonstrate  its estimates are representative of long run experience
    449
     estimates must be grounded in historical experience and empirical evidence
 and  not based purely on subjective or judgmental considerations
 any changes in lending  practice or  process for pursuing recoveries over  observation period must be taken  into account
 a banks estimates must promptly reflect  implications of technical advances  and new data and or information
 as it becomes available
 banks must review ir  estimates on a yearly basis or more frequently
    450
     the population of exposures represented in  data used for estimation
 and  lending standards in use when  data were generated
 and or relevant characteristics  should be closely matched to or at least comparable with those of  banks exposures and  standards
 the bank must also demonstrate  economic or market conditions  underlie   data are relevant to current and foreseeable conditions
 for estimates of lgd and ead
  banks must take into account paragraphs 468 to 479
 the number of exposures in   sample and  data period used for quantification must be sufficient to provide  bank with  confidence in  accuracy and robustness of its estimates
 the estimation technique must  perform well in out-of-sample tests
    451
     in general
 estimates of pds
 lgds
 and eads are likely to involve unpredictable  errors
 in order to avoid over-optimism
 a bank must add to its estimates a margin of  conservatism  is related to  likely range of errors
 where methods and data are less  satisfactory and  likely range of errors is larger
  margin of conservatism must be  larger
 supervisors may allow some flexibility in application of  required standards for data   are collected prior to  date of implementation of this framework
 however
 in such  cases banks must demonstrate to ir supervisors  appropriate adjustments have been  made to achieve broad equivalence to  data without such flexibility
 data collected beyond   date of implementation must conform to  minimum standards unless orwise stated
    
ii
     definition of default  452
      a default is considered to have occurred with regard to a particular obligor when  eir or both of  two following events have taken place
    the bank considers   obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to            banking group in full
 without recourse by  bank to actions such as realising           security 
if held
""
  the obligor is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to               banking group
  overdrafts will be considered as being past due once  customer              has breached an advised limit or been advised of a limit smaller than current              outstandings
  453
        the elements to be taken as indications of unlikeliness to pay include
    the bank puts  credit obligation on non-accrued status
  the bank makes a charge-off or account-specific provision resulting from a              significant perceived decline in credit quality subsequent to  bank taking on               exposure
   the bank sells  credit obligation at a material credit-related economic loss
  the bank consents to a distressed restructuring of  credit obligation where this is              likely to result in a diminished financial obligation caused by  material              forgiveness
 or postponement
 of principal
 interest or 
where relevant
 fees
   the bank has filed for  obligors bankruptcy or a similar order in respect of               obligors credit obligation to  banking group
  the obligor has sought or has been placed in bankruptcy or similar protection where              this would avoid or delay repayment of  credit obligation to  banking group
  454
    national supervisors will provide appropriate guidance as to how se elements  must be implemented and monitored
    455
     for retail exposures
  definition of default can be applied at  level of a  particular facility
 rar than at  level of  obligor
 as such
 default by a borrower on one  obligation does not require a bank to treat all or obligations to  banking group as  defaulted
    456
      a bank must record actual defaults on irb exposure classes using this reference  definition
 a bank must also use  reference definition for its estimation of pds
 and 
where  relevant
 lgds and eads
 in arriving at se estimations
 a bank may use external data  available to it  is not itself consistent with  definition
 subject to  requirements set  out in paragraph 462
 however
 in such cases
 banks must demonstrate to ir supervisors   appropriate adjustments to  data have been made to achieve broad equivalence with   reference definition
 this same condition would apply to any internal data used up to  implementation of this framework
 internal data 
including  pooled by banks
 used in  such estimates beyond  date of implementation of this framework must be consistent with   reference definition
    457
     if  bank considers  a previously defaulted exposures status is such  no  trigger of  reference definition any longer applies
  bank must rate  borrower and  estimate lgd as y would for a non-defaulted facility
 should  reference definition  subsequently be triggered
 a second default would be deemed to have occurred
        in  case of retail and pse obligations
 for  90 days figure
 a supervisor may substitute a  figure up to 180       days for different products
 as it considers appropriate to local conditions
 in one member  country
 local       conditions make it appropriate to use a figure of up to 180 days also for lending by its banks  to corporates
 this       applies for a transitional period of 5 years
  in some jurisdictions
 specific provisions on equity exposures are set aside for price risk and  do not signal       default
  including
" in  case of equity holdings assessed under a pd/lgd approach"
 such distressed  restructuring of        equity itself
        
iii
    re-ageing  458
      the bank must have clearly articulated and documented policies in respect of   counting of days past due
 in particular in respect of  re-ageing of  facilities and   granting of extensions
 deferrals
 renewals and rewrites to existing accounts
 at a minimum
   re-ageing policy must include
 
a
 approval authorities and reporting requirements
 
b
  minimum age of a facility before it is eligible for re-ageing
 
c
 delinquency levels of facilities   are eligible for re-ageing
 
d
 maximum number of re-ageings per facility
 and 
e
 a  reassessment of  borrowers capacity to repay
 these policies must be applied  consistently over time
 and must support  use test 
i
e
 if a bank treats a re-aged  exposure in a similar fashion to or delinquent exposures more than  past-due cut off  point
 this exposure must be recorded as in default for irb purposes
""
 some supervisors  may choose to establish more specific requirements on re-ageing for banks in ir  jurisdiction
    
iv
     treatment of overdrafts  459
      authorised overdrafts must be subject to a credit limit set by  bank and brought to   knowledge of  client
 any break of this limit must be monitored
 if  account were  not  brought under  limit after 90 to 180 days 
subject to  applicable past-due trigger
""
 it  would be considered as defaulted
 non-authorised overdrafts will be associated with a zero  limit for irb purposes
 thus
 days past due commence once any credit is granted to an  unauthorised customer
 if such credit were not repaid within 90 to 180 days
  exposure  would be considered in default
 banks must have in place rigorous internal policies for  assessing  creditworthiness of customers who are offered overdraft accounts
    
v
      definition of loss for all asset classes  460
     the definition of loss used in estimating lgd is economic loss
 when measuring  economic loss
 all relevant factors should be taken into account
 this must include material  discount effects and material direct and indirect costs associated with collecting on   exposure
 banks must not simply measure  loss recorded in accounting records
 although  y must be able to compare accounting and economic losses
 the banks own workout and  collection expertise significantly influences ir recovery rates and must be reflected in ir  lgd estimates
 but adjustments to estimates for such expertise must be conservative until   bank has sufficient internal empirical evidence of  impact of its expertise
    
vi
     requirements specific to pd estimation  corporate
 sovereign
 and bank exposures  461
    banks must use information and techniques  take appropriate account of   long-run experience when estimating  average pd for each rating grade
 for example
  banks may use one or more of  three specific techniques set out below
 internal default  experience
 mapping to external data
 and statistical default models
    462
     banks may have a primary technique and use ors as a point of comparison and  potential adjustment
 supervisors will not be satisfied by mechanical application of a  technique without supporting analysis
 banks must recognise  importance of judgmental  considerations in combining results of techniques and in making adjustments for limitations  of techniques and information
  a bank may use data on internal default experience for  estimation of pd
 a bank          must demonstrate in its analysis   estimates are reflective of underwriting          standards and of any differences in  rating system  generated  data and           current rating system
 where only limited data are available
 or where          underwriting standards or rating systems have changed
  bank must add a          greater margin of conservatism in its estimate of pd
 the use of pooled data across          institutions may also be recognised
 a bank must demonstrate   internal          rating systems and criteria of or banks in  pool are comparable with its own
  banks may associate or map ir internal grades to  scale used by an external          credit assessment institution or similar institution and n attribute  default rate          observed for  external institutions grades to  banks grades
 mappings must          be based on a comparison of internal rating criteria to  criteria used by           external institution and on a comparison of  internal and external ratings of any          common borrowers
 biases or inconsistencies in  mapping approach or          underlying data must be avoided
 the external institutions criteria underlying           data used for quantification must be oriented to  risk of  borrower and not          reflect transaction characteristics
 the banks analysis must include a comparison of           default definitions used
 subject to  requirements in paragraph 452 to 457
          the bank must document  basis for  mapping
  a bank is allowed to use a simple average of default-probability estimates for          individual borrowers in a given grade
 where such estimates are drawn from          statistical default prediction models
 the banks use of default probability models for          this purpose must meet  standards specified in paragraph 417
  463
     irrespective of wher a bank is using external
 internal
 or pooled data sources
 or  a combination of  three
 for its pd estimation
  length of  underlying historical  observation period used must be at least five years for at least one source
 if  available  observation period spans a longer period for any source
 and this data are relevant and  material
 this longer period must be used
    retail exposures  464
     given  bank-specific basis of assigning exposures to pools
 banks must regard  internal data as  primary source of information for estimating loss characteristics
 banks  are permitted to use external data or statistical models for quantification provided a strong  link can be demonstrated between 
a
  banks process of assigning exposures to a pool  and  process used by  external data source
 and 
b
 between  banks internal risk  profile and  composition of  external data
 in all cases banks must use all relevant and  material data sources as points of comparison
    465
     one method for deriving long-run average estimates of pd and default-weighted  average loss rates given default 
as defined in paragraph 468
 for retail would be based on  an estimate of  expected long-run loss rate
 a bank may 
i
 use an appropriate pd  estimate to infer  long-run default-weighted average loss rate given default
 or 
ii
 use a  long-run default-weighted average loss rate given default to infer  appropriate pd
 in  eir case
 it is important to recognise   lgd used for  irb capital calculation  cannot be less than  long-run default-weighted average loss rate given default and must  be consistent with  concepts defined in paragraph 468
    466
     irrespective of wher banks are using external
 internal
 pooled data sources
 or a  combination of  three
 for ir estimation of loss characteristics
  length of   underlying historical observation period used must be at least five years
 if  available  observation spans a longer period for any source
 and se data are relevant
 this longer  period must be used
 a bank need not give equal importance to historic data if it can  convince its supervisor  more recent data are a better predictor of loss rates
  467
      the committee recognises  seasoning can be quite material for some long-term  retail exposures characterised by seasoning effects  peak several years after origination
  banks should anticipate  implications of rapid exposure growth and take steps to ensure   ir estimation techniques are accurate
 and  ir current capital level and earnings  and funding prospects are adequate to cover ir future capital needs
 in order to avoid  gyrations in ir required capital positions arising from short-term pd horizons
 banks are  also encouraged to adjust pd estimates upward for anticipated seasoning effects
 provided  such adjustments are applied in a consistent fashion over time
 within some jurisdictions
  such adjustments might be made mandatory
 subject to supervisory discretion
    
vii
    requirements specific to own-lgd estimates  standards for all asset classes  468
      a bank must estimate an lgd for each facility  aims to reflect economic  downturn conditions where necessary to capture  relevant risks
 this lgd cannot be less  than  long-run default-weighted average loss rate given default calculated based on   average economic loss of all observed defaults within  data source for  type of facility
  in addition
 a bank must take into account  potential for  lgd of  facility to be higher  than  default-weighted average during a period when credit losses are substantially higher  than average
 for certain types of exposures
 loss severities may not exhibit such cyclical  variability and lgd estimates may not differ materially 
or possibly at all
 from  long-run  default-weighted average
 however
 for or exposures
 this cyclical variability in loss  severities may be important and banks will need to incorporate it into ir lgd estimates
  for this purpose
 banks may use averages of loss severities observed during periods of high  credit losses
 forecasts based on appropriately conservative assumptions
 or or similar  methods
" appropriate estimates of lgd during periods of high credit losses might be formed  using eir internal and/or external data"
 supervisors will continue to monitor and encourage   development of appropriate approaches to this issue
    469
      in its analysis
  bank must consider  extent of any dependence between   risk of  borrower and  of  collateral or collateral provider
 cases where re is a  significant degree of dependence must be addressed in a conservative manner
 any  currency mismatch between  underlying obligation and  collateral must also be  considered and treated conservatively in  banks assessment of lgd
    470
     lgd estimates must be grounded in historical recovery rates and
 when applicable
  must not solely be based on  collaterals estimated market value
 this requirement  recognises  potential inability of banks to gain both control of ir collateral and liquidate  it expeditiously
 to  extent
  lgd estimates take into account  existence of  collateral
 banks must establish internal requirements for collateral management
 operational  procedures
 legal certainty and risk management process  are generally consistent with  those required for  standardised approach
    471
      recognising  principle  realised losses can at times systematically exceed  expected levels
  lgd assigned to a defaulted asset should reflect  possibility    bank would have to recognise additional
 unexpected losses during  recovery period
 for  each defaulted asset
  bank must also construct its best estimate of  expected loss on   asset based on current economic circumstances and facility status
 the amount
 if any
  by which  lgd on a defaulted asset exceeds  bank  best estimate of expected loss on   asset represents  capital requirement for  asset
 and should be set by  bank on  a risk-sensitive basis in accordance with paragraphs 272 and 328 to 330
 instances where   best estimate of expected loss on a defaulted asset is less than  sum of specific  provisions and partial charge-offs on  asset will attract supervisory scrutiny and must be  justified by  bank
  additional standards for corporate
 sovereign
 and bank exposures  472
     estimates of lgd must be based on a minimum data observation period  should  ideally cover at least one complete economic cycle but must in any case be no shorter than a  period of seven years for at least one source
 if  available observation period spans a  longer period for any source
 and  data are relevant
 this longer period must be used
    additional standards for retail exposures  473
    the minimum data observation period for lgd estimates for retail exposures is five  years
 the less data a bank has
  more conservative it must be in its estimation
 a bank  need not give equal importance to historic data if it can demonstrate to its supervisor   more recent data are a better predictor of loss rates
    
viii
   requirements specific to own-ead estimates  standards for all asset classes  474
      ead for an on-balance sheet or off-balance sheet item is defined as  expected  gross exposure of  facility upon default of  obligor
 for on-balance sheet items
 banks  must estimate ead at no less than  current drawn amount
 subject to recognising   effects of on-balance sheet netting as specified in  foundation approach
 the minimum  requirements for  recognition of netting are  same as those under  foundation  approach
 the additional minimum requirements for internal estimation of ead under   advanced approach
 refore
 focus on  estimation of ead for off-balance sheet items  
excluding derivatives
""
 advanced approach banks must have established procedures in  place for  estimation of ead for off-balance sheet items
 these must specify   estimates of ead to be used for each facility type
 banks estimates of ead should reflect   possibility of additional drawings by  borrower up to and after  time a default event is  triggered
 where estimates of ead differ by facility type
  delineation of se facilities  must be clear and unambiguous
    475
     advanced approach banks must assign an estimate of ead for each facility
 it must  be an estimate of  long-run default-weighted average ead for similar facilities and  borrowers over a sufficiently long period of time
 but with a margin of conservatism  appropriate to  likely range of errors in  estimate
 if a positive correlation can  reasonably be expected between  default frequency and  magnitude of ead
  ead  estimate must incorporate a larger margin of conservatism
 moreover
 for exposures for  which ead estimates are volatile over  economic cycle
  bank must use ead estimates   are appropriate for an economic downturn
 if se are more conservative than  long
 run average
 for banks  have been able to develop ir own ead models
 this could be  achieved by considering  cyclical nature
 if any
 of  drivers of such models
 or  banks may have sufficient internal data to examine  impact of previous recession
s
""
  however
 some banks may only have  option of making conservative use of external data
    476
     the criteria by which estimates of ead are derived must be plausible and intuitive
  and represent what  bank believes to be  material drivers of ead
 the choices must be  supported by credible internal analysis by  bank
 the bank must be able to provide a  breakdown of its ead experience by  factors it sees as  drivers of ead
 a bank must  use all relevant and material information in its derivation of ead estimates
 across facility  types
 a bank must review its estimates of ead when material new information comes to light  and at least on an annual basis
    477
    due consideration must be paid by  bank to its specific policies and strategies  adopted in respect of account monitoring and payment processing
 the bank must also  consider its ability and willingness to prevent furr drawings in circumstances short of  payment default
 such as covenant violations or or technical default events
 banks must  also have adequate systems and procedures in place to monitor facility amounts
 current  outstandings against committed lines and changes in outstandings per borrower and per  grade
 the bank must be able to monitor outstanding balances on a daily basis
    additional standards for corporate
 sovereign
 and bank exposures  478
     estimates of ead must be based on a time period  must ideally cover a  complete economic cycle but must in any case be no shorter than a period of seven years
 if   available observation period spans a longer period for any source
 and  data are  relevant
 this longer period must be used
 ead estimates must be calculated using a default
 weighted average and not a time-weighted average
    additional standards for retail exposures  479
    the minimum data observation period for ead estimates for retail exposures is five  years
 the less data a bank has
  more conservative it must be in its estimation
 a bank  need not give equal importance to historic data if it can demonstrate to its supervisor   more recent data are a better predictor of drawdowns
    
ix
    minimum requirements for assessing effect of guarantees and credit derivatives  standards for corporate
 sovereign
 and bank exposures where own estimates of lgd are  used and standards for retail exposures  guarantees  480
     when a bank uses its own estimates of lgd
 it may reflect  risk-mitigating effect  of guarantees through an adjustment to pd or lgd estimates
 the option to adjust lgds is  available only to those banks  have been approved to use ir own internal estimates of  lgd
 for retail exposures
 where guarantees exist
 eir in support of an individual  obligation or a pool of exposures
 a bank may reflect  risk-reducing effect eir through  its estimates of pd or lgd
 provided this is done consistently
 in adopting one or  or  technique
 a bank must adopt a consistent approach
 both across types of guarantees and  over time
    481
     in all cases
 both  borrower and all recognised guarantors must be assigned a  borrower rating at  outset and on an ongoing basis
 a bank must follow all minimum  requirements for assigning borrower ratings set out in this document
 including  regular  monitoring of  guarantors condition and ability and willingness to honour its obligations
  consistent with  requirements in paragraphs 430 and 431
 a bank must retain all relevant  information on  borrower absent  guarantee and  guarantor
 in  case of retail  guarantees
 se requirements also apply to  assignment of an exposure to a pool
 and   estimation of pd
    482
    in no case can  bank assign  guaranteed exposure an adjusted pd or lgd  such   adjusted risk weight would be lower than  of a comparable
 direct exposure  to  guarantor
 neir criteria nor rating processes are permitted to consider possible  favourable effects of imperfect expected correlation between default events for  borrower  and guarantor for purposes of regulatory minimum capital requirements
 as such
   adjusted risk weight must not reflect  risk mitigation of double default
  eligible guarantors and guarantees  483
     there are no restrictions on  types of eligible guarantors
 the bank must
  however
 have clearly specified criteria for  types of guarantors it will recognise for  regulatory capital purposes
    484
      the guarantee must be evidenced in writing
 non-cancellable on  part of   guarantor
 in force until  debt is satisfied in full 
to  extent of  amount and tenor of   guarantee
 and legally enforceable against  guarantor in a jurisdiction where   guarantor has assets to attach and enforce a judgement
 however
 in contrast to   foundation approach to corporate
 bank
 and sovereign exposures
 guarantees prescribing  conditions under which  guarantor may not be obliged to perform 
conditional guarantees
  may be recognised under certain conditions
 specifically
  onus is on  bank to  demonstrate   assignment criteria adequately address any potential reduction in   risk mitigation effect
    adjustment criteria  485
     a bank must have clearly specified criteria for adjusting borrower grades or lgd  estimates 
or in  case of retail and eligible purchased receivables
  process of  allocating exposures to pools
 to reflect  impact of guarantees for regulatory capital  purposes
 these criteria must be as detailed as  criteria for assigning exposures to  grades consistent with paragraphs 410 and 411
 and must follow all minimum requirements  for assigning borrower or facility ratings set out in this document
    486
     the criteria must be plausible and intuitive
 and must address  guarantors ability  and willingness to perform under  guarantee
 the criteria must also address  likely  timing of any payments and  degree to which  guarantors ability to perform under   guarantee is correlated with  borrowers ability to repay
 the banks criteria must also  consider  extent to which residual risk to  borrower remains
 for example a currency  mismatch between  guarantee and  underlying exposure
    487
     in adjusting borrower grades or lgd estimates 
or in  case of retail and eligible  purchased receivables
  process of allocating exposures to pools
""
 banks must take all  relevant available information into account
    credit derivatives  488
      the minimum requirements for guarantees are relevant also for single-name credit  derivatives
 additional considerations arise in respect of asset mismatches
 the criteria used  for assigning adjusted borrower grades or lgd estimates 
or pools
 for exposures hedged  with credit derivatives must require   asset on which  protection is based 
  reference asset
 cannot be different from  underlying asset
 unless  conditions outlined  in  foundation approach are met
    489
    in addition
  criteria must address  payout structure of  credit derivative and  conservatively assess  impact this has on  level and timing of recoveries
 the bank  must also consider  extent to which or forms of residual risk remain
    for banks using foundation lgd estimates  490
    the minimum requirements outlined in paragraphs 480 to 489 apply to banks using   foundation lgd estimates with  following exceptions
    
1
      the bank is not able to use an lgd-adjustment option
 and  
2
     the range of eligible guarantees and guarantors is limited to those outlined in          paragraph 302
    
x
     requirements specific to estimating pd and lgd 
or el
 for qualifying purchased          receivables  491
     the following minimum requirements for risk quantification must be satisfied for any  purchased receivables 
corporate or retail
" making use of  top-down treatment of default  risk and/or  irb treatments of dilution risk"
    492
     the purchasing bank will be required to group  receivables into sufficiently  homogeneous pools so  accurate and consistent estimates of pd and lgd 
or el
 for  default losses and el estimates of dilution losses can be determined
 in general
  risk  bucketing process will reflect  sellers underwriting practices and  heterogeneity of its  customers
 in addition
 methods and data for estimating pd
 lgd
 and el must comply with   existing risk quantification standards for retail exposures
 in particular
 quantification  should reflect all information available to  purchasing bank regarding  quality of   underlying receivables
 including data for similar pools provided by  seller
 by   purchasing bank
 or by external sources
 the purchasing bank must determine wher   data provided by  seller are consistent with expectations agreed upon by both parties  concerning
 for example
  type
 volume and on-going quality of receivables purchased
  where this is not  case

    minimum operational requirements  493
     a bank purchasing receivables has to justify confidence  current and future  advances can be repaid from  liquidation of 
or collections against
  receivables pool

 specifically
 a bank will have to  demonstrate  following
    legal certainty  494

    effectiveness of work-out systems  496
     an effective programme requires systems and procedures not only for detecting  deterioration in  sellers financial condition and deterioration in  quality of   receivables at an early stage
 but also for addressing emerging problems pro-actively
 in  particular
    the bank should have clear and effective policies
 procedures
 and information           systems to monitor compliance with

 this includes both self-liquidating debt  arising from  sale of goods or services linked to a commercial transaction and general  amounts owed by buyers
 suppliers
 renters
 national and local governmental authorities
 or  or non-affiliated parties not related to  sale of goods or services linked to a commercial  transaction
 eligible receivables do not include those associated with securitisations
 sub
 participations or credit derivatives

 first liens are subject to  prior right of preferential  creditors
 such as       outstanding tax claims and employees wages

    513
     banks must take all steps necessary to fulfil local requirements in respect of   enforceability of security interest
 
 by registering a security interest with a registrar
 there  should be a framework  allows  potential lender to have a perfected first priority claim  over  collateral
    514
     all documentation used in collateralised transactions must be binding on all parties  and legally enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions
 banks must have conducted sufficient  legal review to verify this and have a well founded legal basis to reach this conclusion
 and  undertake such furr review as necessary to ensure continuing enforceability
    515
     the collateral arrangements must be properly documented
 with a clear and robust  procedure for  timely collection of collateral proceeds
 banks procedures should ensure   any legal conditions required for declaring  default of  customer and timely  collection of collateral are observed
 in  event of  obligors financial distress or default
   bank should have legal authority to sell or assign  receivables to or parties without  consent of  receivables obligors
    risk management  516
      the bank must have a sound process for determining  credit risk in   receivables
 such a process should include
 among or things
 analyses of  borrowers  business and industry 
""
 effects of  business cycle
 and  types of customers with  whom  borrower does business
 where  bank relies on  borrower to ascertain   credit risk of  customers
  bank must review  borrowers credit policy to ascertain its  soundness and credibility

     the margin between  amount of  exposure and  value of  receivables  must reflect all appropriate factors
 including  cost of collection
 concentration within   receivables pool pledged by an individual borrower
 and potential concentration risk within   banks total exposures
    518
     the bank must maintain a continuous monitoring process  is appropriate for   specific exposures

 observance of  banks overall  concentration limits should be monitored
 additionally
 compliance with loan covenants
  environmental restrictions
 and or legal requirements should be reviewed on a regular  basis

 where  correlation is high
 
 where some issuers of   receivables are reliant on  borrower for ir viability or  borrower and  issuers  belong to a common industry
  attendant risks should be taken into account in  setting  of margins for  collateral pool as a whole
 receivables from affiliates of  borrower  
including subsidiaries and employees
 will not be recognised as risk mitigants

      supervisors may allow for recognition of  credit risk mitigating effect of certain  or physical collateral
 each supervisor will determine which
 if any
 collateral types in its  jurisdiction meet  following two standards
    existence of liquid markets for disposal of collateral in an expeditious and           economically efficient manner
  existence of well established
 publicly available market prices for  collateral
           supervisors will seek to ensure   amount a bank receives when collateral is           realised does not deviate significantly from se market prices
  522
     in order for a given bank to receive recognition for additional physical collateral
 it  must meet all  standards in paragraphs 509 and 510
 subject to  following  modifications
  first claim
 with  sole exception of permissible prior claims specified in footnote           87
 only first liens on

""
 in addition
  bank must also meet  following standards
    robust risk management on  part of  lessor with respect to  location of            asset

     leases  expose  bank to residual value risk will be treated in  following  manner
 residual value risk is  banks exposure to potential loss due to  fair value of   equipment declining below its residual estimate at lease inception
    the discounted lease payment stream will receive a risk weight appropriate for           lessees financial strength

     calculation of capital charges for equity exposures  
i
     the internal models market-based approach  525
     to be eligible for  internal models market-based approach a bank must  demonstrate to its supervisor  it meets certain quantitative and qualitative minimum  requirements at  outset and on an ongoing basis
 a bank  fails to demonstrate  continued compliance with  minimum requirements must develop a plan for rapid return  to  compliance
 obtain its supervisors approval of  plan
 and implement  plan in a timely  fashion
 in  interim
 banks would be expected to compute capital charges using a simple  risk weight approach
    526
     the committee recognises  differences in markets
 measurement  methodologies
 equity investments and management practices require banks and  supervisors to customise ir operational procedures
 it is not  committees intention to  dictate  form or operational detail of banks risk management policies and measurement  practices for ir banking book equity holdings
 however
 some of  minimum  requirements are specific
 each supervisor will develop detailed examination procedures to  ensure  banks risk measurement systems and management controls are adequate to  serve as  basis for  internal models approach
    
ii
    capital charge and risk quantification  527
   the following minimum quantitative standards apply for  purpose of calculating  minimum capital charges under  internal models approach
    
a
     the capital charge is equivalent to  potential loss on  institutions equity          portfolio arising from an assumed instantaneous shock equivalent to  99th          percentile
 one-tailed confidence interval of  difference between quarterly returns          and an appropriate risk-free rate computed over a long-term sample period
    
b
     the estimated losses should be robust to adverse market movements relevant to           long-term risk profile of  institutions specific holdings
 the data used to          represent return distributions should reflect  longest sample period for which data          are available and meaningful in representing  risk profile of  banks specific          equity holdings
 the data used should be sufficient to provide conservative
          statistically reliable and robust loss estimates  are not based purely on          subjective or judgmental considerations
 institutions must demonstrate to          supervisors   shock employed provides a conservative estimate of potential          losses over a relevant long-term market or business cycle
 models estimated using          data not reflecting realistic ranges of long-run experience
 including a period of          reasonably severe declines in equity market values relevant to a banks holdings
          are presumed to produce optimistic results unless re is credible evidence of        appropriate adjustments built into  model
 in  absence of built-in adjustments
         bank must combine empirical analysis of available data with adjustments based        on a variety of factors in order to attain model outputs  achieve appropriate        realism and conservatism
 in constructing value at risk 
var
 models estimating        potential quarterly losses
 institutions may use quarterly data or convert shorter        horizon period data to a quarterly equivalent using an analytically appropriate        method supported by empirical evidence
 such adjustments must be applied        through a well-developed and well-documented thought process and analysis
 in        general
 adjustments must be applied conservatively and consistently over time
        furrmore
 where only limited data are available
 or where technical limitations are        such  estimates from any single method will be of uncertain quality
 banks must        add appropriate margins of conservatism in order to avoid over-optimism
    
c
   no particular type of var model 
""
 variance-covariance
 historical simulation
 or        monte carlo
 is prescribed
 however
  model used must be able to capture        adequately all of  material risks embodied in equity returns including both         general market risk and specific risk exposure of  institutions equity portfolio
        internal models must adequately explain historical price variation
 capture both         magnitude and changes in  composition of potential concentrations
 and be        robust to adverse market environments
 the population of risk exposures        represented in  data used for estimation must be closely matched to or at least        comparable with those of  banks equity exposures
    
d
   banks may also use modelling techniques such as historical scenario analysis to        determine minimum capital requirements for banking book equity holdings
 the use        of such models is conditioned upon  institution demonstrating to its supervisor          methodology and its output can be quantified in  form of  loss        percentile specified under 
a

g
   mapping of individual positions to proxies

 and demonstrated with both oretical and empirical        evidence to be appropriate for  specific holdings
 where professional judgement        is combined with quantitative techniques in estimating a holdings return volatility
         judgement must take into account  relevant and material information not        considered by  or techniques utilised
    
h
   where factor models are used
 eir single or multi-factor models are acceptable        depending upon  nature of an institutions holdings
 banks are expected to        ensure   factors are sufficient to capture  risks inherent in  equity        portfolio
 risk factors should correspond to  appropriate equity market        characteristics 
for example
 public
 private
 market capitalisation industry sectors          and sub-sectors
 operational characteristics
 in which  bank holds significant          positions
 while banks will have discretion in choosing  factors
 y must          demonstrate through empirical analyses  appropriateness of those factors
          including ir ability to cover both general and specific risk
    
i
     estimates of  return volatility of equity investments must incorporate relevant and          material available data
 information
 and methods
 a bank may utilise independently          reviewed internal data or data from external sources 
including pooled data
""
 the          number of risk exposures in  sample
 and  data period used for quantification          must be sufficient to provide  bank with confidence in  accuracy and          robustness of its estimates
 institutions should take appropriate measures to limit           potential of both sampling bias and survivorship bias in estimating return          volatilities
    
j
     a rigorous and comprehensive stress-testing programme must be in place
 banks          are expected to subject ir internal model and estimation procedures
 including          volatility computations
 to eir hypotical or historical scenarios  reflect          worst-case losses given underlying positions in both public and private equities
 at a          minimum
 stress tests should be employed to provide information about  effect of          tail events beyond  level of confidence assumed in  internal models approach
    
iii
   risk management process and controls  528
     banks overall risk management practices used to manage ir banking book equity  investments are expected to be consistent with  evolving sound practice guidelines issued  by  committee and national supervisors
 with regard to  development and use of  internal models for capital purposes
 institutions must have established policies
 procedures
  and controls to ensure  integrity of  model and modelling process used to derive  regulatory capital standards
 these policies
 procedures
 and controls should include   following
    
a
     full integration of  internal model into  overall management information          systems of  institution and in  management of  banking book equity          portfolio
 internal models should be fully integrated into  institutions risk          management infrastructure including use in
 
i
 establishing investment hurdle rates          and evaluating alternative investments
 
ii
 measuring and assessing equity portfolio          performance 
including  risk-adjusted performance
""
 and 
iii
 allocating economic          capital to equity holdings and evaluating overall capital adequacy as required under          pillar 2
 the institution should be able to demonstrate
 through for example
          investment committee minutes
  internal model output plays an essential role in           investment management process
    
b
     established management systems
 procedures
 and control functions for ensuring           periodic and independent review of all elements of  internal modelling          process
 including approval of model revisions
 vetting of model inputs
 and review          of model results
 such as direct verification of risk computations
 proxy and mapping          techniques and or critical model components should receive special attention
          these reviews should assess  accuracy
 completeness
 and appropriateness of          model inputs and results and focus on both finding and limiting potential errors          associated with known weaknesses and identifying unknown model weaknesses
          such reviews may be conducted as part of internal or external audit programmes
 by          an independent risk control unit
 or by an external third party
    
c
     adequate systems and procedures for monitoring investment limits and  risk          exposures of equity investments
  
d
     the units responsible for  design and application of  model must be          functionally independent from  units responsible for managing individual          investments
    
e
     parties responsible for any aspect of  modelling process must be adequately          qualified
 management must allocate sufficient skilled and competent resources to           modelling function
    
iv
    validation and documentation  529
      institutions employing internal models for regulatory capital purposes are expected  to have in place a robust system to validate  accuracy and consistency of  model and  its inputs
 they must also fully document all material elements of ir internal models and  modelling process
 the modelling process itself as well as  systems used to validate  internal models including all supporting documentation
 validation results
 and  findings of  internal and external reviews are subject to oversight and review by  banks supervisor
    validation  530
      banks must have a robust system in place to validate  accuracy and consistency  of ir internal models and modelling processes
 a bank must demonstrate to its supervisor    internal validation process enables it to assess  performance of its internal model  and processes consistently and meaningfully
    531
     banks must regularly compare actual return performance 
computed using realised  and unrealised gains and losses
 with modelled estimates and be able to demonstrate   such returns are within  expected range for  portfolio and individual holdings
 such  comparisons must make use of historical data  are over as long a period as possible
 the  methods and data used in such comparisons must be clearly documented by  bank
 this  analysis and documentation should be updated at least annually
    532
      banks should make use of or quantitative validation tools and comparisons with  external data sources
 the analysis must be based on data  are appropriate to   portfolio
 are updated regularly
 and cover a relevant observation period
 banks internal  assessments of  performance of ir own model must be based on long data histories
  covering a range of economic conditions
 and ideally one or more complete business cycles
    533
     banks must demonstrate  quantitative validation methods and data are  consistent through time
 changes in estimation methods and data 
both data sources and  periods covered
 must be clearly and thoroughly documented
    534
     since  evaluation of actual performance to expected performance over time  provides a basis for banks to refine and adjust internal models on an ongoing basis
 it is  expected  banks using internal models will have established well-articulated model  review standards
 these standards are especially important for situations where actual  results significantly deviate from expectations and where  validity of  internal model is  called into question
 these standards must take account of business cycles and similar  systematic variability in equity returns
 all adjustments made to internal models in response  to model reviews must be well documented and consistent with  banks model review  standards
    535
     to facilitate model validation through backtesting on an ongoing basis
 institutions  using  internal model approach must construct and maintain appropriate databases on   actual quarterly performance of ir equity investments as well on  estimates derived  using ir internal models
 institutions should also backtest  volatility estimates used  within ir internal models and  appropriateness of  proxies used in  model
  supervisors may ask banks to scale ir quarterly forecasts to a different
 in particular  shorter
 time horizon
 store performance data for this time horizon and perform backtests on  this basis
    documentation  536
     the burden is on  bank to satisfy its supervisor  a model has good predictive  power and  regulatory capital requirements will not be distorted as a result of its use
  accordingly
 all critical elements of an internal model and  modelling process should be  fully and adequately documented
 banks must document in writing ir internal models  design and operational details
 the documentation should demonstrate banks compliance  with  minimum quantitative and qualitative standards
 and should address topics such as   application of  model to different segments of  portfolio
 estimation methodologies
  responsibilities of parties involved in  modelling
 and  model approval and model  review processes
 in particular
  documentation should address  following points
    
a
     a bank must document  rationale for its choice of internal modelling methodology          and must be able to provide analyses demonstrating   model and modelling          procedures are likely to result in estimates  meaningfully identify  risk of           banks equity holdings
 internal models and procedures must be periodically          reviewed to determine wher y remain fully applicable to  current portfolio          and to external conditions
 in addition
 a bank must document a history of major          changes in  model over time and changes made to  modelling process          subsequent to  last supervisory review
 if changes have been made in response          to  banks internal review standards
  bank must document  se changes          are consistent with its internal model review standards
    
b
     in documenting ir internal models banks should
    provide a detailed outline of  ory
" assumptions and/or mamatical and          empirical basis of  parameters"
 variables
 and data source
s
 used to estimate           model
  establish a rigorous statistical process 
including out-of-time and out-of-sample          performance tests
 for validating  selection of explanatory variables
 and  indicate circumstances under which  model does not work effectively
  
c
     where proxies and mapping are employed
 institutions must have performed and          documented rigorous analysis demonstrating  all chosen proxies and mappings          are sufficiently representative of  risk of  equity holdings to which y          correspond
 the documentation should show
 for instance
  relevant and material          factors 
""
 business lines
 balance sheet characteristics
 geographic location
          company age
 industry sector and subsector
 operating characteristics
 used in          mapping individual investments into proxies
 in summary
 institutions must          demonstrate   proxies and mappings employed
    are adequately comparable to  underlying holding or portfolio
  are derived using historical economic and market conditions  are relevant and          material to  underlying holdings or
 where not
  an appropriate adjustment has          been made
 and
  are robust estimates of  potential risk of  underlying holding
  12
     disclosure requirements  537
    in order to be eligible for  irb approach
 banks must meet  disclosure  requirements set out in pillar 3
 these are minimum requirements for use of irb
 failure to  meet se will render banks ineligible to use  relevant irb approach
  iv
      credit risk  securitisation framework  a
       scope and definitions of transactions covered under  securitisation           framework  538
      banks must apply  securitisation framework for determining regulatory capital  requirements on exposures arising from traditional and syntic securitisations or similar  structures  contain features common to both
 since securitisations may be structured in  many different ways
  capital treatment of a securitisation exposure must be determined  on  basis of its economic substance rar than its legal form
 similarly
 supervisors will  look to  economic substance of a transaction to determine wher it should be subject to   securitisation framework for purposes of determining regulatory capital
 banks are  encouraged to consult with ir national supervisors when re is uncertainty about  wher a given transaction should be considered a securitisation
 for example
 transactions  involving cash flows from real estate 
""
 rents
 may be considered specialised lending  exposures
 if warranted
    539
      a traditional securitisation is a structure where  cash flow from an underlying pool  of exposures is used to service at least two different stratified risk positions or tranches  reflecting different degrees of credit risk
 payments to  investors depend upon   performance of  specified underlying exposures
 as opposed to being derived from an  obligation of  entity originating those exposures
" the stratified/tranched structures   characterise securitisations differ from ordinary senior/subordinated debt instruments in   junior securitisation tranches can absorb losses without interrupting contractual payments to  more senior tranches"
" whereas subordination in a senior/subordinated debt structure is a  matter of priority of rights to  proceeds of liquidation"
    540
     a syntic securitisation is a structure with at least two different stratified risk  positions or tranches  reflect different degrees of credit risk where credit risk of an  underlying pool of exposures is transferred
 in whole or in part
 through  use of funded  
""
 credit-linked notes
 or unfunded 
""
 credit default swaps
 credit derivatives or  guarantees  serve to hedge  credit risk of  portfolio
 accordingly
  investors  potential risk is dependent upon  performance of  underlying pool
    541
     banks exposures to a securitisation are hereafter referred to as securitisation  exposures
 securitisation exposures can include but are not restricted to  following
  asset-backed securities
 mortgage-backed securities
 credit enhancements
 liquidity facilities
  interest rate or currency swaps
 credit derivatives and tranched cover as described in  paragraph 199
 reserve accounts
 such as cash collateral accounts
 recorded as an asset  by  originating bank must also be treated as securitisation exposures
    542
      underlying instruments in  pool being securitised may include but are not  restricted to  following
 loans
 commitments
 asset-backed and mortgage-backed  securities
 corporate bonds
 equity securities
 and private equity investments
 the underlying  pool may include one or more exposures

     a clean-up call is an option  permits  securitisation exposures 
""
 asset
 backed securities
 to be called before all of  underlying exposures or securitisation  exposures have been repaid
 in  case of traditional securitisations
 this is generally  accomplished by repurchasing  remaining securitisation exposures once  pool balance  or outstanding securities have fallen below some specified level
 in  case of a syntic  transaction
  clean-up call may take  form of a clause  extinguishes  credit  protection
      4
       credit enhancement  546
     a credit enhancement is a contractual arrangement in which  bank retains or  assumes a securitisation exposure and

       early amortisation  548
     early amortisation provisions are mechanisms 
 once triggered
 allow investors  to be paid out prior to  originally stated maturity of  securities issued
 for risk-based  capital purposes
 an early amortisation provision will be considered eir controlled or non
 controlled
 a controlled early amortisation provision must meet all of  following conditions
    
a
"      the bank must have an appropriate capital/liquidity plan in place to ensure  it           has sufficient capital and liquidity available in  event of an early amortisation"

c
      the bank must set a period for amortisation  would be sufficient for at least 90%           of  total debt outstanding at  beginning of  early amortisation period to have           been repaid or recognised as in default
 and  
d
     the pace of repayment should not be any more rapid than would be allowed by          straight-line amortisation over  period set out in criterion 
c
""
    549
    an early amortisation provision  does not satisfy  conditions for a controlled  early amortisation provision will be treated as a non-controlled early amortisation provision

      excess spread  550
    excess spread is generally defined as gross finance charge collections and or  income received by  trust or special purpose entity 
spe
 specified in paragraph 552
  minus certificate interest
 servicing fees
 charge-offs
 and or senior trust or spe  expenses

spe
  552
      an spe is a corporation
 trust
 or or entity organised for a specific purpose
   activities of which are limited to those appropriate to accomplish  purpose of  spe
 and   structure of which is intended to isolate  spe from  credit risk of an originator or  seller of exposures
 spes are commonly used as financing vehicles in which exposures are  sold to a trust or similar entity in exchange for cash or or assets funded by debt issued by   trust
      c
      operational requirements for  recognition of risk transference  553
    the following operational requirements are applicable to both  standardised and  irb approaches of  securitisation framework
      1
      operational requirements for traditional securitisations  554
     an originating bank may exclude securitised exposures from  calculation of risk
 weighted assets only if all of  following conditions have been met
 banks meeting se  conditions must still hold regulatory capital against any securitisation exposures y retain
    
a
     significant credit risk associated with  securitised exposures has been          transferred to third parties
    
b
     the transferor does not maintain effective or indirect control over  transferred          exposures
 the assets are legally isolated from  transferor in such a way 
""
          through  sale of assets or through subparticipation
   exposures are put          beyond  reach of  transferor and its creditors
 even in bankruptcy or          receivership
 these conditions must be supported by an opinion provided by a          qualified legal counsel
            the transferor is deemed to have maintained effective control over  transferred          credit risk exposures if it
 
i
 is able to repurchase from  transferee  previously          transferred exposures in order to realise ir benefits
 or 
ii
 is obligated to retain           risk of  transferred exposures
 the transferors retention of servicing rights to           exposures will not necessarily constitute indirect control of  exposures
  
c
     the securities issued are not obligations of  transferor
 thus
 investors who          purchase  securities only have claim to  underlying pool of exposures
    
d

 in case re is a  maturity mismatch
  capital requirement will be determined in accordance with paragraphs  202 to 205
 when  exposures in  underlying pool have different maturities
  longest  maturity must be taken as  maturity of  pool
 maturity mismatches may arise in   context of syntic securitisations when
 for example
 a bank uses credit derivatives to  transfer part or all of  credit risk of a specific pool of assets to third parties
 when   credit derivatives unwind
  transaction will terminate
 this implies   effective  maturity of  tranches of  syntic securitisation may differ from  of  underlying  exposures
 originating banks of syntic securitisations must treat such maturity  mismatches in  following manner
 a bank using  standardised approach for  securitisation must deduct all retained positions  are unrated or rated below investment  grade
 a bank using  irb approach must deduct unrated
 retained positions if   treatment of  position is deduction specified in paragraphs 609 to 643

      the following operational criteria concerning  use of external credit assessments  apply in  standardised and irb approaches of  securitisation framework
    
a
      to be eligible for risk-weighting purposes
  external credit assessment must take           into account and reflect  entire amount of credit risk exposure  bank has with           regard to all payments owed to it
 for example
 if a bank is owed both principal and           interest
  assessment must fully take into account and reflect  credit risk           associated with timely repayment of both principal and interest
    
b
      the external credit assessments must be from an eligible ecai as recognised by            banks national supervisor in accordance with paragraphs 90 to 108 with            following exception
 in contrast with bullet three of paragraph 91
 an eligible credit           assessment must be publicly available
 in or words
 a rating must be published in           an accessible form and included in  ecais transition matrix
 consequently
          ratings  are made available only to  parties to a transaction do not satisfy this          requirement
    
c
     eligible ecais must have a demonstrated expertise in assessing securitisations
          which may be evidenced by strong market acceptance
    
d
     a bank must apply external credit assessments from eligible ecais consistently          across a given type of securitisation exposure
 furrmore
 a bank cannot use           credit assessments issued by one ecai for one or more tranches and those of          anor ecai for or positions 
wher retained or purchased
 within  same          securitisation structure  may or may not be rated by  first ecai
 where two or          more eligible ecais can be used and se assess  credit risk of  same          securitisation exposure differently
 paragraphs 96 to 98 will apply

     ratings-based approach 
rba
  611
     under  rba
  risk-weighted assets are determined by multiplying  amount  of  exposure by  appropriate risk weights
 provided in  tables below
    612
       the risk weights depend on 
i
  external rating grade or an available inferred  rating

 represents a long-term or a short
 term credit rating
 
iii
  granularity of  underlying pool and 
iv
  seniority of   position
    613
      for purposes of  rba
 a securitisation exposure is treated as a senior tranche if it  is effectively backed or secured by a first claim on  entire amount of  assets in   underlying securitised pool
 while this generally includes only  most senior position within  a securitisation transaction
 in some instances re may be some or claim 
 in a  technical sense
 may be more senior in  waterfall 
""
 a swap claim
 but may be  disregarded for  purpose of determining which positions are subject to  senior  tranches column
    examples
    
a
      in a typical syntic securitisation
  super-senior tranche would be treated as a           senior tranche
 provided  all of  conditions for inferring a rating from a lower           tranche are fulfilled
    
b
      in a traditional securitisation where all tranches above  first-loss piece are rated
            most highly rated position would be treated as a senior tranche
 however
 when           re are several tranches  share  same rating
 only  most senior one in            waterfall would be treated as senior
    
c
      usually a liquidity facility supporting an abcp programme would not be  most           senior position within  programme
  commercial paper
 which benefits from            liquidity support
 typically would be  most senior position
 however
 if  liquidity           facility is sized to cover all of  outstanding commercial paper
" it can be viewed as          covering all losses on  underlying receivables pool  exceed  amount of          over-collateralisation/reserves provided by  seller and as being most senior"
 as a          result
  rba risk weights in  left-most column can be used for such positions

5 times historical losses for an asset type to obtain a single          a rating equivalent and anor required 2 to 3 times historical losses

 n  revised rating methodology must be          considered in evaluating wher  internal assessments assigned to abcp          programme exposures are in need of revision
  a bank cannot utilise an ecais rating methodology to derive an internal        assessment if  ecais process or rating criteria is not publicly available

  623
     as in  irb approaches
 risk-weighted assets generated through  use of  sf  are calculated by multiplying  capital charge by 12

      tranches irb capital charge    amount of exposures  have been securitised times  greater of                where  function  
termed  supervisory formula
 is defined in  following             paragraph
 when  bank holds only a proportional interest in  tranche
              positions capital charge equals  prorated share of  capital charge for              entire tranche
    624
       the supervisory formula is given by  following expression

  including assets in which  spe may have invested a reserve account
 such as a cash  collateral account
    628
     if  risk weight resulting from  sf is 1250%
 banks must deduct   securitisation exposure subject to  risk weight in accordance with paragraphs 561 to 563
    629
     in cases where a bank has set aside a specific provision or has a non-refundable  purchase price discount on an exposure in  pool
 quantity 
a
 defined above and quantity  
b
" also defined above must be calculated using  gross amount of  exposure without   specific provision and/or non-refundable purchase price discount"
 in this case
   amount of  non-refundable purchase price discount on a defaulted asset or  specific  provision can be used to reduce  amount of any deduction from capital associated with   securitisation exposure
        the cumulative beta distribution function is available
 for example
 in excel as  function  betadist
        credit enhancement level 
l
  630
     l is measured 
in decimal form
 as  ratio of 
a
  amount of all securitisation  exposures subordinate to  tranche in question to 
b
  amount of exposures in  pool
  banks will be required to determine l before considering  effects of any tranche-specific  credit enhancements
 such as third-party guarantees  benefit only a single tranche
" any  gain-on-sale and/or credit enhancing i/os associated with  securitisation are not to be  included in  measurement of l"
 the size of interest rate or currency swaps  are more  junior than  tranche in question may be measured at ir current values 
without   potential future exposures
 in calculating  enhancement level
 if  current value of   instrument cannot be measured
  instrument should be ignored in  calculation of l
    631
     if re is any reserve account funded by accumulated cash flows from   underlying exposures  is more junior than  tranche in question
 this can be included in   calculation of l
 unfunded reserve accounts may not be included if y are to be funded  from future receipts from  underlying exposures
    thickness of exposure 
t
  632
     t is measured as  ratio of 
a
  nominal size of  tranche of interest to 
b
   notional amount of exposures in  pool
 in  case of an exposure arising from an interest  rate or currency swap
  bank must incorporate potential future exposure
 if  current  value of  instrument is non-negative
  exposure size should be measured by   current value plus  add-on as in  1988 accord
 if  current value is negative
   exposure should be measured by using  potential future exposure only
    effective number of exposures 
n
  633
     the effective number of exposures is calculated as
           where eadi represents  exposure-at-default associated with  ith instrument in  pool
  multiple exposures to  same obligor must be consolidated

 if  portfolio share associated with  largest  exposure
 c1
 is available
"  bank may compute n as 1/c1"
    exposure-weighted average lgd  634
     the exposure-weighted average lgd is calculated as follows
           where lgdi represents  average lgd associated with all exposures to  ith obligor
 in   case of re-securitisation
 an lgd of 100% must be assumed for  underlying  securitised exposures
 when default and dilution risks for purchased receivables are treated  in an aggregate manner 
""
 a single reserve or over-collateralisation is available to cover  losses from eir source
 within a securitisation
  lgd input must be constructed as a  weighted-average of  lgd for default risk and  100% lgd for dilution risk
 the weights  are  stand-alone irb capital charges for default risk and dilution risk
 respectively
    simplified method for computing n and lgd  635
    for securitisations involving retail exposures
 subject to supervisory review
  sf  may be implemented using  simplifications
     636
     under  conditions provided below
 banks may employ a simplified method for  calculating  effective number of exposures and  exposure-weighted average lgd
 let  cm in  simplified calculation denote  share of  pool corresponding to  sum of   largest m exposures 
""
 a 15% share corresponds to a value of 0

or 3% of  underlying pool
""
 n for purposes of  sf
  bank may set             and n equal to  following amount              alternatively
 if only c1 is available and this amount is no more than 0
03
 n             bank may set     
vii
     liquidity facilities  637
     liquidity facilities are treated as any or securitisation exposure and receive a  ccf of 100% unless specified differently in paragraphs 638 to 641
 if  facility is externally  rated
  bank may rely on  external rating under  rba
 if  facility is not rated and  an inferred rating is not available
  bank must apply  sf
 unless  iaa can be  applied
    638
      an eligible liquidity facility  can only be drawn in  event of a general market  disruption as defined in paragraph 580 is assigned a 20% ccf under  sf
 that is
 an irb  bank is to recognise 20% of  capital charge generated under  sf for  facility
 if   eligible facility is externally rated
  bank may rely on  external rating under  rba  provided it assigns a 100% ccf rar than a 20% ccf to  facility
    639
       when it is not practical for  bank to use eir  bottom-up approach or  top
 down approach for calculating kirb
  bank may
 on an exceptional basis and subject to  supervisory consent
 temporarily be allowed to apply  following method
 if  liquidity  facility meets  definition in paragraph 578 or 580
  highest risk weight assigned under   standardised approach to any of  underlying individual exposures covered by   liquidity facility can be applied to  liquidity facility
 if  liquidity facility meets   definition  in paragraph 578
  ccf must be 50% for a facility with an original maturity of one year or  less
 or 100% if  facility has an original maturity of more than one year
 if  liquidity  facility meets  definition in paragraph 580
  ccf must be 20%
 in all or cases
   notional amount of  liquidity facility must deducted
    
viii
    treatment of overlapping exposures  640
      overlapping exposures are treated as described in paragraph 581
  
ix
     eligible servicer cash advance facilities  641
     eligible servicer cash advance facilities are treated as specified in paragraph 582
    
x
      treatment of credit risk mitigation for securitisation exposures  642
     as with  rba
 banks are required to apply  crm techniques as specified in   foundation irb approach of section iii when applying  sf
 the bank may reduce   capital charge proportionally when  credit risk mitigant covers first losses or losses on a  proportional basis
 for all or cases
  bank must assume   credit risk mitigant  covers  most senior portion of  securitisation exposure 
i
e
   most junior portion  of  securitisation exposure is uncovered
""
 examples for recognising collateral and  guarantees under  sf are provided in annex 5
    
xi
     capital requirement for early amortisation provisions  643
      an originating bank must use  methodology and treatment described in  paragraphs 590 to 605 for determining if any capital must be held against  investors  interest
 for banks using  irb approach to securitisation
 investors interest is defined as  investors drawn balances related to securitisation exposures and ead associated with  investors undrawn lines related to securitisation exposures
 for determining  ead
   undrawn balances of securitised exposures would be allocated between  sellers and  investors interests on a pro rata basis
 based on  proportions of  sellers and investors  shares of  securitised drawn balances
 for irb purposes
  capital charge attributed to   investors interest is determined by  product of 
a
  investors interest
 
b
   appropriate ccf
 and 
c
 kirb
  v
          operational risk  a
          definition of operational risk  644
       operational risk is defined as  risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed  internal processes
 people and systems or from external events
 this definition includes legal  risk
 but excludes strategic and reputational risk
      b
          the measurement methodologies  645
     the framework outlined below presents three methods for calculating operational  risk capital charges in a continuum of increasing sophistication and risk sensitivity
 
i
   basic indicator approach
 
ii
  standardised approach
 and 
iii
 advanced measurement  approaches 
ama
""
    646
       banks are encouraged to move along  spectrum of available approaches as y  develop more sophisticated operational risk measurement systems and practices
 qualifying  criteria for  standardised approach and ama are presented below
    647
      internationally active banks and banks with significant operational risk exposures  
for example
 specialised processing banks
 are expected to use an approach  is more  sophisticated than  basic indicator approach and  is appropriate for  risk profile of   institution
  a bank will be permitted to use  basic indicator or standardised  approach for some parts of its operations and an ama for ors provided certain minimum  criteria are met
 see paragraphs 680 to 683
    648
     a bank will not be allowed to choose to revert to a simpler approach once it has  been approved for a more advanced approach without supervisory approval
 however
 if a  supervisor determines  a bank using a more advanced approach no longer meets   qualifying criteria for this approach
 it may require  bank to revert to a simpler approach  for some or all of its operations
 until it meets  conditions specified by  supervisor for  returning to a more advanced approach
      1
          the basic indicator approach  649
     banks using  basic indicator approach must hold capital for operational risk  equal to  average over  previous three years of a fixed percentage 
denoted alpha
 of  positive annual gross income
 figures for any year in which annual gross income is negative  or zero should be excluded from both  numerator and denominator when calculating   average
 the charge may be expressed as follows
          legal risk includes
 but is not limited to
 exposure to fines
 penalties
 or punitive damages  resulting from       supervisory actions
 as well as private settlements
  supervisors will review  capital requirement produced by  operational risk approach  used by a bank       
wher basic indicator approach
 standardised approach or ama
 for general credibility
  especially in       relation to a firms peers
 in  event  credibility is lacking
 appropriate supervisory  action under pillar 2       will be considered
  if negative gross income distorts a banks pillar 1 capital charge
 supervisors will consider  appropriate       supervisory action under pillar 2
  where    kbia is  capital charge under  basic indicator approach    gi is annual gross income
 where positive
 over  previous three years    n is number of  previous three years for which gross income is positive     which is set by  committee
 relating  industry wide level of required capital to   industry wide level of  indicator
    650
       gross income is defined as net interest income plus net non-interest income
  it is  intended  this measure should
 
i
 be gross of any provisions 
""
 for unpaid interest
""
  
ii
 be gross of operating expenses
 including fees paid to outsourcing service providers
   
iii
" exclude realised profits/losses from  sale of securities in  banking book"
 and  
iv
 exclude extraordinary or irregular items as well as income derived from insurance
    651
     as a point of entry for capital calculation
 no specific criteria for use of  basic  indicator approach are set out in this framework
 neverless
 banks using this approach  are encouraged to comply with  committees guidance on sound practices for   management and supervision of operational risk
 february 2003
"          as defined by national supervisors and/or national accounting standards"
  in contrast to fees paid for services  are outsourced
 fees received by banks  provide  outsourcing       services shall be included in  definition of gross income
"  realised profits/losses from securities classified as held to maturity and available for sale"
  which typically       constitute items of  banking book 
""
 under certain accounting standards
""
 are also  excluded from        definition of gross income
  2
           the standardised approach   652
     in  standardised approach
 banks activities are divided into eight business lines
  corporate finance
 trading & sales
 retail banking
 commercial banking
 payment &  settlement
 agency services
 asset management
 and retail brokerage
 the business lines  are defined in detail in annex 6
    653
     within each business line
 gross income is a broad indicator  serves as a proxy  for  scale of business operations and thus  likely scale of operational risk exposure  within each of se business lines
 the capital charge for each business line is calculated  by multiplying gross income by a factor 
denoted beta
 assigned to  business line
 beta  serves as a proxy for  industry-wide relationship between  operational risk loss  experience for a given business line and  aggregate level of gross income for   business line
 it should be noted  in  standardised approach gross income is  measured for each business line
 not  whole institution
 i
e
 in corporate finance
   indicator is  gross income generated in  corporate finance business line
          the committee intends to reconsider  calibration of  basic indicator and standardised  approaches       when more risk-sensitive data are available to carry out this recalibration
 any such  recalibration would not be       intended to affect significantly  overall calibration of  operational risk component of   pillar 1 capital       charge
  97       the alternative standardised approach       at national supervisory discretion a supervisor can choose to allow a bank to use   alternative standardised       approach 
asa
 provided  bank is able to satisfy its supervisor  this alternative  approach provides an       improved basis by
 for example
 avoiding double counting of risks
 once a bank has been  allowed to use        asa
 it will not be allowed to revert to use of  standardised approach without   permission of its       supervisor
 it is not envisaged  large diversified banks in major markets would use   asa
       under  asa
"  operational risk capital charge/methodology is  same as for   standardised approach       except for two business lines  retail banking and commercial banking"
 for se business  lines
 loans and       advances  multiplied by a fixed factor m  replaces gross income as  exposure  indicator
 the betas for       retail and commercial banking are unchanged from  standardised approach
 the asa  operational risk       capital charge for retail banking 
with  same basic formula for commercial banking
 can  be expressed as
             where       krb is  capital charge for  retail banking business line        is  beta for  retail banking business line       larb is total outstanding retail loans and advances 
non-risk weighted and gross of  provisions
""
 averaged over        past three years             for  purposes of  asa
 total loans and advances in  retail banking business line  consists of  total       drawn amounts in  following credit portfolios
 retail
 smes treated as retail
 and  purchased retail       receivables
 for commercial banking
 total loans and advances consists of  drawn  amounts in  following       credit portfolios
 corporate
 sovereign
 bank
 specialised lending
 smes treated as  corporate and purchased       corporate receivables
 the book value of securities held in  banking book should also be  included
       under  asa
 banks may aggregate retail and commercial banking 
if y wish to
 using  a beta of 15%
       similarly
 those banks  are unable to disaggregate ir gross income into  or six  business lines can       aggregate  total gross income for se six business lines using a beta of 18%
 with  negative gross income       treated as described in paragraph 654
       as under  standardised approach
  total capital charge for  asa is calculated as   simple       summation of  regulatory capital charges across each of  eight business lines
  654
    the total capital charge is calculated as  three-year average of  simple  summation of  regulatory capital charges across each of  business lines in each year
  in any given year
 negative capital charges 
resulting from negative gross income
 in any  business line may offset positive capital charges in or business lines without limit
   however
 where  aggregate capital charge across all business lines within a given year is  negative
 n  input to  numerator for  year will be zero
 the total capital charge  may be expressed as
    ktsa        ktsa is  capital charge under  standardised approach    gi1-8 is annual gross income in a given year
 as defined above in  basic indicator        approach
 for each of  eight business lines    a fixed percentage
 set by  committee
 relating  level of required capital to         level of  gross income for each of  eight business lines
 the values of  betas        are detailed below
                               business lines                      beta factors                             corporate finance                          18%                             trading and sales                        18%                             retail banking                            12%                             commercial banking                         15%                             payment and settlement                18%                             agency services                           15%                             asset management                         12%                             retail brokerage                        12%      3
          advanced measurement approaches 
ama
  655
    under  ama
  regulatory capital requirement will equal  risk measure  generated by  banks internal operational risk measurement system using  quantitative  and qualitative criteria for  ama discussed below
 use of  ama is subject to  supervisory approval
    656
     a bank adopting  ama may
 with  approval of its host supervisors and   support of its home supervisor
 use an allocation mechanism for  purpose of determining   regulatory capital requirement for internationally active banking subsidiaries  are not  deemed to be significant relative to  overall banking group but are mselves subject to  this framework in accordance with part 1
 supervisory approval would be conditional on   bank demonstrating to  satisfaction of  relevant supervisors   allocation        at national discretion
 supervisors may adopt a more conservative treatment of negative gross  income
  as under  basic indicator approach
 if negative gross income distorts a banks pillar 1 capital  charge under        standardised approach
 supervisors will consider appropriate supervisory action under  pillar 2
  mechanism for se subsidiaries is appropriate and can be supported empirically
 the  board of directors and senior management of each subsidiary are responsible for conducting  ir own assessment of  subsidiarys operational risks and controls and ensuring   subsidiary is adequately capitalised in respect of those risks
    657
     subject to supervisory approval as discussed in paragraph 669
d
""
  incorporation  of a well-reasoned estimate of diversification benefits may be factored in at  group-wide  level or at  banking subsidiary level
 however
 any banking subsidiaries whose host  supervisors determine  y must calculate stand-alone capital requirements 
see part 1
  may not incorporate group-wide diversification benefits in ir ama calculations 
""
 where  an internationally active banking subsidiary is deemed to be significant
  banking  subsidiary may incorporate  diversification benefits of its own operations  those arising at   sub-consolidated level  but may not incorporate  diversification benefits of   parent
""
    658
     the appropriateness of  allocation methodology will be reviewed with  consideration given to  stage of development of risk-sensitive allocation techniques and   extent to which it reflects  level of operational risk in  legal entities and across   banking group
 supervisors expect  ama banking groups will continue efforts to develop  increasingly risk-sensitive operational risk allocation techniques
 notwithstanding initial  approval of techniques based on gross income or or proxies for operational risk
    659
     banks adopting  ama will be required to calculate ir capital requirement using  this approach as well as  1988 accord as outlined in paragraph 46
      c
           qualifying criteria  1
           the standardised approach   660
    in order to qualify for use of  standardised approach
 a bank must satisfy its  supervisor 
 at a minimum
    its board of directors and senior management
 as appropriate
 are actively involved               in  oversight of  operational risk management framework
  it has an operational risk management system  is conceptually sound and is               implemented with integrity
 and  it has sufficient resources in  use of  approach in  major business lines as               well as  control and audit areas
  661
    supervisors will have  right to insist on a period of initial monitoring of a banks  standardised approach before it is used for regulatory capital purposes
    662
     a bank must develop specific policies and have documented criteria for mapping  gross income for current business lines and activities into  standardised framework
 the  criteria must be reviewed and adjusted for new or changing business activities as  appropriate
 the principles for business line mapping are set out in annex 6
           supervisors allowing banks to use  alternative standardised approach must decide on   appropriate        qualifying criteria for  approach
 as  criteria set forth in paragraphs 662 and 663 of  this section may not        be appropriate
  663
      as some internationally active banks will wish to use  standardised approach
 it  is important  such banks have adequate operational risk management systems
  consequently
 an internationally active bank using  standardised approach must meet   following additional criteria
     
a
         the bank must have an operational risk management system with clear              responsibilities assigned to an operational risk management function
 the              operational risk management function is responsible for developing strategies to              identify
 assess
" monitor and control/mitigate operational risk"
 for codifying firm-level              policies and procedures concerning operational risk management and controls
 for               design and implementation of  firms operational risk assessment              methodology
 and for  design and implementation of a risk-reporting system for              operational risk
    
b
         as part of  banks internal operational risk assessment system
  bank must              systematically track relevant operational risk data including material losses by              business line
 its operational risk assessment system must be closely integrated into               risk management processes of  bank
 its output must be an integral part of               process of monitoring and controlling  banks operational risk profile
 for              instance
 this information must play a prominent role in risk reporting
 management              reporting
 and risk analysis
 the bank must have techniques for creating incentives              to improve  management of operational risk throughout  firm
    
c
         there must be regular reporting of operational risk exposures
 including material              operational losses
 to business unit management
 senior management
 and to               board of directors
 the bank must have procedures for taking appropriate action              according to  information within  management reports
    
d
         the banks operational risk management system must be well documented
 the              bank must have a routine in place for ensuring compliance with a documented set of              internal policies
 controls and procedures concerning  operational risk              management system
 which must include policies for  treatment of non
             compliance issues
    
e
         the banks operational risk management processes and assessment system must              be subject to validation and regular independent review
 these reviews must include              both  activities of  business units and of  operational risk management              function
    
f
         the banks operational risk assessment system 
including  internal validation              processes
" must be subject to regular review by external auditors and/or              supervisors"

 are actively involved           in  oversight of  operational risk management framework
    it has an operational risk management system  is conceptually sound and is           implemented with integrity
 and    it has sufficient resources in  use of  approach in  major business lines as           well as  control and audit areas
    665
     a banks ama will be subject to a period of initial monitoring by its supervisor before  it can be used for regulatory purposes
 this period will allow  supervisor to determine  wher  approach is credible and appropriate
 as discussed below
 a banks internal  measurement system must reasonably estimate unexpected losses based on  combined  use of internal and relevant external loss data
 scenario analysis and bank-specific business  environment and internal control factors
 the banks measurement system must also be  capable of supporting an allocation of economic capital for operational risk across business  lines in a manner  creates incentives to improve business line operational risk  management
    
ii
     qualitative standards  666
    a bank must meet  following qualitative standards before it is permitted to use an  ama for operational risk capital
    
a
      the bank must have an independent operational risk management function  is           responsible for  design and implementation of  banks operational risk           management framework
 the operational risk management function is responsible           for codifying firm-level policies and procedures concerning operational risk           management and controls
 for  design and implementation of  firms           operational risk measurement methodology
 for  design and implementation of a           risk-reporting system for operational risk
 and for developing strategies to identify
           measure
" monitor and control/mitigate operational risk"
    
b
      the banks internal operational risk measurement system must be closely integrated           into  day-to-day risk management processes of  bank
 its output must be an           integral part of  process of monitoring and controlling  banks operational risk           profile
 for instance
 this information must play a prominent role in risk reporting
           management reporting
 internal capital allocation
 and risk analysis
 the bank must           have techniques for allocating operational risk capital to major business lines and for           creating incentives to improve  management of operational risk throughout            firm
    
c
      there must be regular reporting of operational risk exposures and loss experience           to business unit management
 senior management
 and to  board of directors
           the bank must have procedures for taking appropriate action according to            information within  management reports
    
d
      the banks operational risk management system must be well documented
 the           bank must have a routine in place for ensuring compliance with a documented set of           internal policies
 controls and procedures concerning  operational risk           management system
 which must include policies for  treatment of non
          compliance issues
    
e
"      internal and/or external auditors must perform regular reviews of  operational risk           management processes and measurement systems"
 this review must include both            activities of  business units and of  independent operational risk           management function
    
f
"      the validation of  operational risk measurement system by external auditors           and/or supervisory authorities must include  following"
    verifying   internal validation processes are operating in a satisfactory           manner
 and  making sure  data flows and processes associated with  risk measurement           system are transparent and accessible
 in particular
 it is necessary  auditors           and supervisory authorities are in a position to have easy access
 whenever y           judge it necessary and under appropriate procedures
 to  systems specifications           and parameters
    
iii
    quantitative standards  ama soundness standard  667
     given  continuing evolution of analytical approaches for operational risk
   committee is not specifying  approach or distributional assumptions used to generate   operational risk measure for regulatory capital purposes
 however
 a bank must be able to  demonstrate  its approach captures potentially severe tail loss events
 whatever  approach is used
 a bank must demonstrate  its operational risk measure meets a  soundness standard comparable to  of  internal ratings-based approach for credit risk
  
i
e
 comparable to a one year holding period and a 99
9th percentile confidence interval
""
    668
       the committee recognises   ama soundness standard provides significant  flexibility to banks in  development of an operational risk measurement and management  system
 however
 in  development of se systems
 banks must have and maintain  rigorous procedures for operational risk model development and independent model  validation
 prior to implementation
  committee will review evolving industry practices  regarding credible and consistent estimates of potential operational losses
 it will also review  accumulated data
 and  level of capital requirements estimated by  ama
 and may  refine its proposals if appropriate
    detailed criteria  669
     this section describes a series of quantitative standards  will apply to internally
 generated operational risk measures for purposes of calculating  regulatory minimum  capital charge
    
a
      any internal operational risk measurement system must be consistent with            scope of operational risk defined by  committee in paragraph 644 and  loss           event types defined in annex 7
    
b
      supervisors will require  bank to calculate its regulatory capital requirement as            sum of expected loss 
el
 and unexpected loss 
ul
""
 unless  bank can           demonstrate  it is adequately capturing el in its internal business practices
 that           is
 to base  minimum regulatory capital requirement on ul alone
  bank must           be able to demonstrate to  satisfaction of its national supervisor  it has           measured and accounted for its el exposure
    
c
      a banks risk measurement system must be sufficiently granular to capture            major drivers of operational risk affecting  shape of  tail of  loss estimates
  
d
      risk measures for different operational risk estimates must be added for purposes           of calculating  regulatory minimum capital requirement
 however
  bank may           be permitted to use internally determined correlations in operational risk losses           across individual operational risk estimates
 provided it can demonstrate to            satisfaction of  national supervisor  its systems for determining correlations           are sound
 implemented with integrity
 and take into account  uncertainty           surrounding any such correlation estimates 
particularly in periods of stress
""
 the           bank must validate its correlation assumptions using appropriate quantitative and           qualitative techniques
    
e
      any operational risk measurement system must have certain key features to meet            supervisory soundness standard set out in this section
 these elements must           include  use of internal data
 relevant external data
 scenario analysis and factors           reflecting  business environment and internal control systems
    
f
      a bank needs to have a credible
 transparent
 well-documented and verifiable           approach for weighting se fundamental elements in its overall operational risk           measurement system
 for example
 re may be cases where estimates of            99
9th percentile confidence interval based primarily on internal and external loss           event data would be unreliable for business lines with a heavy-tailed loss distribution           and a small number of observed losses
 in such cases
 scenario analysis
 and           business environment and control factors
 may play a more dominant role in  risk           measurement system
 conversely
 operational loss event data may play a more           dominant role in  risk measurement system for business lines where estimates of            99
9th percentile confidence interval based primarily on such data are deemed           reliable
 in all cases
  bank  approach for weighting  four fundamental           elements should be internally consistent and avoid  double counting of qualitative           assessments or risk mitigants already recognised in or elements of            framework
    internal data  670
     banks must track internal loss data according to  criteria set out in this section
  the tracking of internal loss event data is an essential prerequisite to  development and  functioning of a credible operational risk measurement system
 internal loss data is crucial  for tying a bank  risk estimates to its actual loss experience
 this can be achieved in a  number of ways
 including using internal loss data as  foundation of empirical risk  estimates
 as a means of validating  inputs and outputs of  bank  risk measurement  system
 or as  link between loss experience and risk management and control decisions
    671
    internal loss data is most relevant when it is clearly linked to a bank  current  business activities
 technological processes and risk management procedures
 therefore
 a  bank must have documented procedures for assessing  on-going relevance of historical  loss data
 including those situations in which judgement overrides
 scaling
 or or  adjustments may be used
 to what extent y may be used and who is authorised to make  such decisions
    672
      internally generated operational risk measures used for regulatory capital purposes  must be based on a minimum five-year observation period of internal loss data
 wher   internal loss data is used directly to build  loss measure or to validate it
 when  bank  first moves to  ama
 a three-year historical data window is acceptable 
this includes   parallel calculations in paragraph 46
""
    673
   to qualify for regulatory capital purposes
 a bank  internal loss collection processes  must meet  following standards
  to assist in supervisory validation
 a bank must be able to map its historical internal               loss data into  relevant level 1 supervisory categories defined in annexes 6 and 7               and to provide se data to supervisors upon request
 it must have documented
               objective criteria for allocating losses to  specified business lines and event               types
 however
 it is left to  bank to decide  extent to which it applies se               categorisations in its internal operational risk measurement system
  a bank  internal loss data must be comprehensive in  it captures all material               activities and exposures from all appropriate sub-systems and geographic locations
               a bank must be able to justify  any excluded activities or exposures
 both               individually and in combination
 would not have a material impact on  overall risk               estimates
 a bank must have an appropriate de minimis gross loss threshold for               internal loss data collection
 for example 10
000
 the appropriate threshold may               vary somewhat between banks
" and within a bank across business lines and/or               event types"
 however
 particular thresholds should be broadly consistent with those               used by peer banks
  aside from information on gross loss amounts
 a bank should collect information               about  date of  event
 any recoveries of gross loss amounts
 as well as some               descriptive information about  drivers or causes of  loss event
 the level of               detail of any descriptive information should be commensurate with  size of                gross loss amount
  a bank must develop specific criteria for assigning loss data arising from an event in               a centralised function 
""
 an information technology department
 or an activity                spans more than one business line
 as well as from related events over time
  operational risk losses  are related to credit risk and have historically been               included in banks credit risk databases 
""
 collateral management failures
 will               continue to be treated as credit risk for  purposes of calculating minimum               regulatory capital under this framework
 therefore
 such losses will not be subject               to  operational risk capital charge
  neverless
 for  purposes of internal               operational risk management
 banks must identify all material operational risk losses               consistent with  scope of  definition of operational risk 
as set out in paragraph               644 and  loss event types outlined in annex 7
""
 including those related to credit               risk
 such material operational risk-related credit risk losses should be flagged               separately within a banks internal operational risk database
 the materiality of               se losses may vary between banks
" and within a bank across business lines               and/or event types"
 materiality thresholds should be broadly consistent with those               used by peer banks
  operational risk losses  are related to market risk are treated as operational risk               for  purposes of calculating minimum regulatory capital under this framework               and will refore be subject to  operational risk capital charge
    external data  674
     a banks operational risk measurement system must use relevant external data  
"eir public data and/or pooled industry data"
""
 especially when re is reason to believe    bank is exposed to infrequent
 yet potentially severe
 losses
 these external data  should include data on actual loss amounts
 information on  scale of business operations  where  event occurred
 information on  causes and circumstances of  loss events
    this applies to all banks
 including those  may only now be designing ir credit risk and  operational risk        databases
  or or information  would help in assessing  relevance of  loss event for or  banks
 a bank must have a systematic process for determining  situations for which  external data must be used and  methodologies used to incorporate  data 
""
 scaling
  qualitative adjustments
 or informing  development of improved scenario analysis
""
 the  conditions and practices for external data use must be regularly reviewed
 documented
 and  subject to periodic independent review
    scenario analysis  675
     a bank must use scenario analysis of expert opinion in conjunction with external  data to evaluate its exposure to high-severity events
 this approach draws on  knowledge  of experienced business managers and risk management experts to derive reasoned  assessments of plausible severe losses
 for instance
 se expert assessments could be  expressed as parameters of an assumed statistical loss distribution
 in addition
 scenario  analysis should be used to assess  impact of deviations from  correlation assumptions  embedded in  banks operational risk measurement framework
 in particular
 to evaluate  potential losses arising from multiple simultaneous operational risk loss events
 over time
  such assessments need to be validated and re-assessed through comparison to actual loss  experience to ensure ir reasonableness
    business environment and internal control factors  676
     in addition to using loss data
 wher actual or scenario-based
 a banks firm-wide  risk assessment methodology must capture key business environment and internal control  factors  can change its operational risk profile
 these factors will make a banks risk  assessments more forward-looking
 more directly reflect  quality of  banks control and  operating environments
 help align capital assessments with risk management objectives
  and recognise both improvements and deterioration in operational risk profiles in a more  immediate fashion
 to qualify for regulatory capital purposes
  use of se factors in a  banks risk measurement framework must meet  following standards
    the choice of each factor needs to be justified as a meaningful driver of risk
 based          on experience and involving  expert judgment of  affected business areas
          whenever possible
  factors should be translatable into quantitative measures           lend mselves to verification
  the sensitivity of a banks risk estimates to changes in  factors and  relative          weighting of  various factors need to be well reasoned
 in addition to capturing          changes in risk due to improvements in risk controls
  framework must also          capture potential increases in risk due to greater complexity of activities or increased          business volume
  the framework and each instance of its application
 including  supporting          rationale for any adjustments to empirical estimates
 must be documented and          subject to independent review within  bank and by supervisors
  over time
  process and  outcomes need to be validated through comparison          to actual internal loss experience
 relevant external data
 and appropriate          adjustments made
  
iv
        risk mitigation   677
    under  ama
 a bank will be allowed to recognise  risk mitigating impact of  insurance in  measures of operational risk used for regulatory minimum capital  requirements
 the recognition of insurance mitigation will be limited to 20% of  total  operational risk capital charge calculated under  ama
    678
     a banks ability to take advantage of such risk mitigation will depend on compliance  with  following criteria
    the insurance provider has a minimum claims paying ability rating of a 
or              equivalent
""
  the insurance policy must have an initial term of no less than one year
 for policies              with a residual term of less than one year
  bank must make appropriate haircuts              reflecting  declining residual term of  policy
 up to a full 100% haircut for              policies with a residual term of 90 days or less
  the insurance policy has a minimum notice period for cancellation of 90 days
  the insurance policy has no exclusions or limitations triggered by supervisory              actions or
 in  case of a failed bank
  preclude  bank
 receiver or liquidator              from recovering for damages suffered or expenses incurred by  bank
 except in              respect of events occurring after  initiation of receivership or liquidation              proceedings in respect of  bank
 provided   insurance policy may exclude              any fine
 penalty
 or punitive damages resulting from supervisory actions
  the risk mitigation calculations must reflect  banks insurance coverage in a              manner  is transparent in its relationship to
 and consistent with
  actual              likelihood and impact of loss used in  banks overall determination of its              operational risk capital
  the insurance is provided by a third-party entity
 in  case of insurance through              captives and affiliates
  exposure has to be laid off to an independent third-party              entity
 for example through re-insurance
  meets  eligibility criteria
  the framework for recognising insurance is well reasoned and documented
  the bank discloses a description of its use of insurance for  purpose of mitigating              operational risk
  679
    a banks methodology for recognising insurance under  ama also needs to  capture  following elements through appropriate discounts or haircuts in  amount of  insurance recognition
    the residual term of a policy
 where less than one year
 as noted above
  a policys cancellation terms
 where less than one year
 and  the uncertainty of payment as well as mismatches in coverage of insurance              policies
          the committee intends to continue an ongoing dialogue with  industry on  use of risk  mitigants for        operational risk and
 in due course
 may consider revising  criteria for and limits on   recognition of        operational risk mitigants on  basis of growing experience
  d
      partial use  680
      a bank will be permitted to use an ama for some parts of its operations and   basic indicator approach or standardised approach for  balance 
partial use

 a significant part of  banks operational          risks are captured by  ama
 and  the bank provides its supervisor with a plan specifying  timetable to which it          intends to roll out  ama across all but an immaterial part of its operations
 the          plan should be driven by  practicality and feasibility of moving to  ama over          time

 consolidated operational risk capital requirements  results of          an ama calculation at a subsidiary where  ama has been approved by           relevant host supervisor and is acceptable to  banks home supervisor
    683
    approvals of  nature described in paragraph 682 should be granted only on an  exceptional basis
 such exceptional approvals should generally be limited to circumstances  where a bank is prevented from meeting se conditions due to implementation decisions of  supervisors of  banks subsidiary operations in foreign jurisdictions

      prudent valuation guidance  690
     this section provides banks with guidance on prudent valuation for positions in   trading book
 this guidance is especially important for less liquid positions which
 although  y will not be excluded from  trading book solely on grounds of lesser liquidity
 raise  supervisory concerns about prudent valuation
    691
     a framework for prudent valuation practices should at a minimum include   following
      1
      systems and controls  692
      banks must establish and maintain adequate systems and controls sufficient to give  management and supervisors  confidence  ir valuation estimates are prudent and  reliable
 these systems must be integrated with or risk management systems within   organisation 
such as credit analysis
""
 such systems must include
    documented policies and procedures for  process of valuation
 this includes          clearly defined responsibilities of  various areas involved in  determination of           valuation
 sources of market information and review of ir appropriateness
          frequency of independent valuation
 timing of closing prices
 procedures for          adjusting valuations
 end of  month and ad-hoc verification procedures
 and    clear and independent

     marking to market  693
     marking-to-market is at least  daily valuation of positions at readily available  close out prices  are sourced independently
 examples of readily available close out  prices include exchange prices
 screen prices
 or quotes from several independent reputable  brokers
    694
     banks must mark-to-market as much as possible
" the more prudent side of bid/offer  must be used unless  institution is a significant market maker in a particular position type  and it can close out at mid-market"
  
ii
     marking to model  695
     where marking-to-market is not possible
 banks may mark-to-model
 where this can  be demonstrated to be prudent
 marking-to-model is defined as any valuation which has to  be benchmarked
 extrapolated or orwise calculated from a market input
 when marking  to  model
 an extra degree of conservatism is appropriate
 supervisory authorities will consider   following in assessing wher a mark-to-model valuation is prudent
"    senior management should be aware of  elements of  trading book which are           subject to mark to model and should understand  materiality of  uncertainty           this creates in  reporting of  risk/performance of  business"
  market inputs should be sourced
 to  extent possible
 in line with market prices           
as discussed above
""
 the appropriateness of  market inputs for  particular           position being valued should be reviewed regularly
  where available
 generally accepted valuation methodologies for particular products           should be used as far as possible
  where  model is developed by  institution itself
 it should be based on           appropriate assumptions
 which have been assessed and challenged by suitably           qualified parties independent of  development process
 the model should be           developed or approved independently of  front office
 it should be independently           tested

  assumptions and  software           implementation
  there should be formal change control procedures in place and a secure copy of            model should be held and periodically used to check valuations
  risk management should be aware of  weaknesses of  models used and how           best to reflect those in  valuation output

    independent price verification  696
     independent price verification is distinct from daily mark-to-market
 it is  process  by which market prices or model inputs are regularly verified for accuracy
 while daily  marking-to-market may be performed by dealers
 verification of market prices or model  inputs should be performed by a unit independent of  dealing room
 at least monthly 
or
"  depending on  nature of  market/trading activity"
 more frequently
""
 it need not be  performed as frequently as daily mark-to-market
 since  objective
 i
e
 independent
  marking of positions
 should reveal any error or bias in pricing
 which should result in   elimination of inaccurate daily marks
    697
     independent price verification entails a higher standard of accuracy in    market prices or model inputs are used to determine profit and loss figures
 whereas daily  marks are used primarily for management reporting in between reporting dates
 for  independent price verification
 where pricing sources are more subjective
 
 only one  available broker quote
 prudent measures such as valuation adjustments may be  appropriate

           valuation adjustments or reserves  698
"    banks must establish and maintain procedures for considering valuation  adjustments/reserves"
 supervisory authorities expect banks using third-party valuations to  consider wher valuation adjustments are necessary
 such considerations are also  necessary when marking to model
    699
"     supervisory authorities expect  following valuation adjustments/reserves to be  formally considered at a minimum"
 unearned credit spreads
 close-out costs
 operational  risks
 early termination
 investing and funding costs
 and future administrative costs and
  where appropriate
 model risk
    700
       in addition
 supervisory authorities will require banks to consider  need for  establishing reserves for less liquid positions 
and on an ongoing basis review ir  continued appropriateness
""
 reduced liquidity could arise from market events
 additionally
"  close-out prices for concentrated positions and/or stale positions are more likely to be  adverse"
 banks must consider several factors when determining wher a valuation reserve  is necessary for less liquid items
" these factors include  amount of time it would take to  hedge out  position/risks within  position"
"  average volatility of bid/offer spreads"
    availability of market quotes 
number and identity of market makers
 and  average and  volatility of trading volumes

           treatment of counterparty credit risk in  trading book  702
     banks will be required to calculate  counterparty credit risk charge for otc  derivatives
 repo-style and or transactions booked in  trading book
 separate from   capital charge for general market risk and specific risk
  the risk weights to be used in this  calculation must be consistent with those used for calculating  capital requirements in   banking book
 thus
 banks using  standardised approach in  banking book will use   standardised approach risk weights in  trading book and banks using  irb approach in   banking book will use  irb risk weights in  trading book in a manner consistent with   irb roll out situation in  banking book as described in paragraphs 256 to 262
 for  counterparties included in portfolios where  irb approach is being used  irb risk  weights will have to be applied

       importance of supervisory review  720
    the supervisory review process of  framework is intended not only to ensure   banks have adequate capital to support all  risks in ir business
 but also to  encourage banks to develop and use better risk management techniques in monitoring and  managing ir risks
    721
    the supervisory review process recognises  responsibility of bank management  in developing an internal capital assessment process and setting capital targets  are  commensurate with  banks risk profile and control environment
 in  framework
 bank  management continues to bear responsibility for ensuring   bank has adequate capital  to support its risks beyond  core minimum requirements
    722
      supervisors are expected to evaluate how well banks are assessing ir capital  needs relative to ir risks and to intervene
 where appropriate
 this interaction is intended  to foster an active dialogue between banks and supervisors such  when deficiencies are  identified
 prompt and decisive action can be taken to reduce risk or restore capital
  accordingly
 supervisors may wish to adopt an approach to focus more intensely on those  banks with risk profiles or operational experience  warrants such attention
    723
     the committee recognises  relationship  exists between  amount of  capital held by  bank against its risks and  strength and effectiveness of  banks risk  management and internal control processes
 however
 increased capital should not be  viewed as  only option for addressing increased risks confronting  bank
 or means  for addressing risk
 such as strengning risk management
 applying internal limits
  strengning  level of provisions and reserves
 and improving internal controls
 must also  be considered
 furrmore
 capital should not be regarded as a substitute for addressing  fundamentally inadequate control or risk management processes
    724
       there are three main areas  might be particularly suited to treatment under  pillar 2
 risks considered under pillar 1  are not fully captured by  pillar 1 process 
""
  credit concentration risk
""
 those factors not taken into account by  pillar 1 process 
""
  interest rate risk in  banking book
 business and strategic risk
""
 and factors external to   bank 
""
 business cycle effects
""
 a furr important aspect of pillar 2 is  assessment of  compliance with  minimum standards and disclosure requirements of  more advanced  methods in pillar 1
 in particular  irb framework for credit risk and  advanced  measurement approaches for operational risk
 supervisors must ensure  se  requirements are being met
 both as qualifying criteria and on a continuing basis
  ii
          four key principles of supervisory review  725
    the committee has identified four key principles of supervisory review
 which  complement those outlined in  extensive supervisory guidance  has been developed  by  committee
  keystone of which is  core principles for effective banking  supervision and  core principles methodology
  a list of  specific guidance relating to   management of banking risks is provided at  end of this part of  framework
    principle 1
 banks should have a process for assessing ir overall capital adequacy  in relation to ir risk profile and a strategy for maintaining ir capital levels
    726
     banks must be able to demonstrate  chosen internal capital targets are well  founded and  se targets are consistent with ir overall risk profile and current  operating environment
 in assessing capital adequacy
 bank management needs to be  mindful of  particular stage of  business cycle in which  bank is operating
 rigorous
  forward-looking stress testing  identifies possible events or changes in market conditions   could adversely impact  bank should be performed
 bank management clearly bears  primary responsibility for ensuring   bank has adequate capital to support its risks
    727
         the five main features of a rigorous process are as follows
  board and senior management oversight
  sound capital assessment
  comprehensive assessment of risks
  monitoring and reporting
 and  internal control review
      1
           board and senior management oversight  728
     a sound risk management process is  foundation for an effective assessment of   adequacy of a banks capital position
 bank management is responsible for  understanding  nature and level of risk being taken by  bank and how this risk relates  to adequate capital levels
 it is also responsible for ensuring   formality and  sophistication of  risk management processes are appropriate in light of  risk profile  and business plan
    729
     the analysis of a banks current and future capital requirements in relation to its  strategic objectives is a vital element of  strategic planning process
 the strategic plan      core principles for effective banking supervision

""
 and core principles methodology
 basel committee on banking supervision  
october 1999
""
  this section of  paper refers to a management structure composed of a board of directors  and senior        management
 the committee is aware  re are significant differences in legislative  and regulatory        frameworks across countries as regards  functions of  board of directors and senior  management
 in        some countries
  board has  main
 if not exclusive
 function of supervising   executive body 
senior        management
 general management
 so as to ensure   latter fulfils its tasks
 for this  reason
 in some        cases
 it is known as a supervisory board
 this means   board has no executive  functions
 in or        countries
 by contrast
  board has a broader competence in  it lays down  general  framework for         management of  bank
 owing to se differences
  notions of  board of directors  and senior        management are used in this section not to identify legal constructs but rar to label two  decision-making        functions within a bank
  should clearly outline  banks capital needs
 anticipated capital expenditures
 desirable  capital level
 and external capital sources
 senior management and  board should view  capital planning as a crucial element in being able to achieve its desired strategic objectives
    730
      the banks board of directors has responsibility for setting  banks tolerance for  risks
 it should also ensure  management establishes a framework for assessing   various risks
 develops a system to relate risk to  banks capital level
 and establishes a  method for monitoring compliance with internal policies
 it is likewise important    board  of directors adopts and supports strong internal controls and written policies and procedures  and ensures  management effectively communicates se throughout  organisation
      2
       sound capital assessment  731
     fundamental elements of sound capital assessment include
    policies and procedures designed to ensure   bank identifies
 measures
 and           reports all material risks
  a process  relates capital to  level of risk
  a process  states capital adequacy goals with respect to risk
 taking account of            banks strategic focus and business plan
 and  a process of internal controls
 reviews and audit to ensure  integrity of  overall           management process
      3
       comprehensive assessment of risks  732
    all material risks faced by  bank should be addressed in  capital assessment  process
 while  committee recognises  not all risks can be measured precisely
 a  process should be developed to estimate risks
 therefore
  following risk exposures
  which by no means constitute a comprehensive list of all risks
 should be considered
    733
      credit risk
 banks should have methodologies  enable m to assess   credit risk involved in exposures to individual borrowers or counterparties as well as at   portfolio level
 for more sophisticated banks
  credit review assessment of capital  adequacy
 at a minimum
 should cover four areas
 risk rating systems
" portfolio  analysis/aggregation"
" securitisation/complex credit derivatives"
 and large exposures and risk  concentrations
    734
     internal risk ratings are an important tool in monitoring credit risk
 internal risk  ratings should be adequate to support  identification and measurement of risk from all  credit exposures
 and should be integrated into an institutions overall analysis of credit risk  and capital adequacy
 the ratings system should provide detailed ratings for all assets
 not  only for criticised or problem assets
 loan loss reserves should be included in  credit risk  assessment for capital adequacy
    735
      the analysis of credit risk should adequately identify any weaknesses at   portfolio level
 including any concentrations of risk
 it should also adequately take into  consideration  risks involved in managing credit concentrations and or portfolio issues  through such mechanisms as securitisation programmes and complex credit derivatives
  furr
  analysis of counterparty credit risk should include consideration of public  evaluation of  supervisors compliance with  core principles for effective banking  supervision
  736
      operational risk
 the committee believes  similar rigour should be applied to   management of operational risk
 as is done for  management of or significant  banking risks
" the failure to properly manage operational risk can result in a misstatement of  an institutions risk/return profile and expose  institution to significant losses"
    737
     a bank should develop a framework for managing operational risk and evaluate   adequacy of capital given this framework
 the framework should cover  banks appetite  and tolerance for operational risk
 as specified through  policies for managing this risk
  including  extent and manner in which operational risk is transferred outside  bank
 it  should also include policies outlining  banks approach to identifying
 assessing
"  monitoring and controlling/mitigating  risk"
    738
      market risk
 this assessment is based largely on  banks own measure of value
 at-risk or  standardised approach for market risk
 emphasis should also be placed on   institution performing stress testing in evaluating  adequacy of capital to support   trading function
    739
     interest rate risk in  banking book
 the measurement process should include  all material interest rate positions of  bank and consider all relevant repricing and maturity  data
 such information will generally include current balance and contractual rate of interest  associated with  instruments and portfolios
 principal payments
 interest reset dates
  maturities
  rate index used for repricing
 and contractual interest rate ceilings or floors for  adjustable-rate items
 the system should also have well-documented assumptions and  techniques
    740
     regardless of  type and level of complexity of  measurement system used
  bank management should ensure  adequacy and completeness of  system
 because   quality and reliability of  measurement system is largely dependent on  quality of   data and various assumptions used in  model
 management should give particular  attention to se items
    741
      liquidity risk
 liquidity is crucial to  ongoing viability of any banking  organisation
 banks capital positions can have an effect on ir ability to obtain liquidity
  especially in a crisis
 each bank must have adequate systems for measuring
 monitoring and  controlling liquidity risk
 banks should evaluate  adequacy of capital given ir own  liquidity profile and  liquidity of  markets in which y operate
    742
     or risks
 although  committee recognises  or risks
 such as  reputational and strategic risk
 are not easily measurable
 it expects industry to furr  develop techniques for managing all aspects of se risks
      4
          monitoring and reporting  743
    the bank should establish an adequate system for monitoring and reporting risk  exposures and assessing how  banks changing risk profile affects  need for capital
  the banks senior management or board of directors should
 on a regular basis
 receive  reports on  banks risk profile and capital needs
 these reports should allow senior  management to
                  see  market risk amendment
  evaluate  level and trend of material risks and ir effect on capital levels
  evaluate  sensitivity and reasonableness of key assumptions used in  capital           assessment measurement system
  determine   bank holds sufficient capital against  various risks and is in           compliance with established capital adequacy goals
 and  assess its future capital requirements based on  banks reported risk profile and           make necessary adjustments to  banks strategic plan accordingly
      5
       internal control review  744
     the banks internal control structure is essential to  capital assessment process
  effective control of  capital assessment process includes an independent review and
  where appropriate
  involvement of internal or external audits
 the banks board of  directors has a responsibility to ensure  management establishes a system for assessing   various risks
 develops a system to relate risk to  banks capital level
 and establishes  a method for monitoring compliance with internal policies
 the board should regularly verify  wher its system of internal controls is adequate to ensure well-ordered and prudent  conduct of business
    745
      the bank should conduct periodic reviews of its risk management process to ensure  its integrity
 accuracy
 and reasonableness
 areas  should be reviewed include
    appropriateness of  banks capital assessment process given  nature
 scope           and complexity of its activities
  identification of large exposures and risk concentrations
  accuracy and completeness of data inputs into  banks assessment process
  reasonableness and validity of scenarios used in  assessment process
 and  stress testing and analysis of assumptions and inputs
    principle 2
 supervisors should review and evaluate banks internal capital adequacy  assessments and strategies
 as well as ir ability to monitor and ensure ir  compliance with regulatory capital ratios
 supervisors should take appropriate  supervisory action if y are not satisfied with  result of this process
    746
     the supervisory authorities should regularly review  process by which a bank  assesses its capital adequacy
 risk position
 resulting capital levels
 and quality of capital  held
 supervisors should also evaluate  degree to which a bank has in place a sound  internal process to assess capital adequacy
 the emphasis of  review should be on   quality of  banks risk management and controls and should not result in supervisors  functioning as bank management
 the periodic review can involve some combination of

  747
    the substantial impact  errors in  methodology or assumptions of formal  analyses can have on resulting capital requirements requires a detailed review by  supervisors of each banks internal analysis
      1
      review of adequacy of risk assessment  748
     supervisors should assess  degree to which internal targets and processes  incorporate  full range of material risks faced by  bank
 supervisors should also review   adequacy of risk measures used in assessing internal capital adequacy and  extent to  which se risk measures are also used operationally in setting limits
 evaluating business  line performance
 and evaluating and controlling risks more generally
 supervisors should  consider  results of sensitivity analyses and stress tests conducted by  institution and  how se results relate to capital plans
      2
      assessment of capital adequacy  749
    supervisors should review  banks processes to determine 
    target levels of capital chosen are comprehensive and relevant to  current          operating environment
  these levels are properly monitored and reviewed by senior management
 and  the composition of capital is appropriate for  nature and scale of  banks          business
  750
     supervisors should also consider  extent to which  bank has provided for  unexpected events in setting its capital levels
 this analysis should cover a wide range of  external conditions and scenarios
 and  sophistication of techniques and stress tests used  should be commensurate with  banks activities
      3
      assessment of  control environment  751
     supervisors should consider  quality of  banks management information  reporting and systems
  manner in which business risks and activities are aggregated
  and managements record in responding to emerging or changing risks
    752
     in all instances
  capital level at an individual bank should be determined  according to  banks risk profile and adequacy of its risk management process and  internal controls
 external factors such as business cycle effects and  macroeconomic  environment should also be considered
      4
      supervisory review of compliance with minimum standards  753
     in order for certain internal methodologies
 credit risk mitigation techniques and  asset securitisations to be recognised for regulatory capital purposes
 banks will need to  meet a number of requirements
 including risk management standards and disclosures
 in  particular
 banks will be required to disclose features of ir internal methodologies used in  calculating minimum capital requirements
 as part of  supervisory review process
  supervisors must ensure  se conditions are being met on an ongoing basis
    754
     the committee regards this review of minimum standards and qualifying criteria as  an integral part of  supervisory review process under principle 2
 in setting  minimum  criteria  committee has considered current industry practice and so anticipates  se  minimum standards will provide supervisors with a useful set of benchmarks  are aligned  with bank management expectations for effective risk management and capital allocation
    755
     there is also an important role for supervisory review of compliance with certain  conditions and requirements set for standardised approaches
 in this context
 re will be a  particular need to ensure  use of various instruments  can reduce pillar 1 capital  requirements are utilised and understood as part of a sound
 tested
 and properly  documented risk management process
      5
       supervisory response  756
    having carried out  review process described above
 supervisors should take  appropriate action if y are not satisfied with  results of  banks own risk assessment  and capital allocation
 supervisors should consider a range of actions
 such as those set out  under principles 3 and 4 below
    principle 3
 supervisors should expect banks to operate above  minimum  regulatory capital ratios and should have  ability to require banks to hold capital in  excess of  minimum
    757
      pillar 1 capital requirements will include a buffer for uncertainties surrounding   pillar 1 regime  affect  banking population as a whole
 bank-specific uncertainties will  be treated under pillar 2
 it is anticipated  such buffers under pillar 1 will be set to provide  reasonable assurance  a bank with good internal systems and controls
 a well-diversified  risk profile and a business profile well covered by  pillar 1 regime
 and which operates  with capital equal to pillar 1 requirements
 will meet  minimum goals for soundness  embodied in pillar 1
 however
 supervisors will need to consider wher  particular  features of  markets for which y are responsible are adequately covered
 supervisors  will typically require 
or encourage
 banks to operate with a buffer
 over and above   pillar 1 standard
 banks should maintain this buffer for a combination of  following
    
a
      pillar 1 minimums are anticipated to be set to achieve a level of bank           creditworthiness in markets  is below  level of creditworthiness sought by           many banks for ir own reasons
 for example
 most international banks appear to           prefer to be highly rated by internationally recognised rating agencies
 thus
 banks           are likely to choose to operate above pillar 1 minimums for competitive reasons
    
b
      in  normal course of business
  type and volume of activities will change
 as           will  different risk exposures
 causing fluctuations in  overall capital ratio
    
c
      it may be costly for banks to raise additional capital
 especially if this needs to be           done quickly or at a time when market conditions are unfavourable
    
d
      for banks to fall below minimum regulatory capital requirements is a serious matter
"           it may place banks in breach of  relevant law and/or prompt non-discretionary           corrective action on  part of supervisors"
    
e
      there may be risks
 eir specific to individual banks
 or more generally to an           economy at large
  are not taken into account in pillar 1
    758
    there are several means available to supervisors for ensuring  individual banks  are operating with adequate levels of capital
 among or methods
  supervisor may set  trigger and target capital ratios or define categories above minimum ratios 
""
 well  capitalised and adequately capitalised
 for identifying  capitalisation level of  bank
    principle 4
 supervisors should seek to intervene at an early stage to prevent capital  from falling below  minimum levels required to support  risk characteristics of a  particular bank and should require rapid remedial action if capital is not maintained or  restored
    759
     supervisors should consider a range of options if y become concerned  a  bank is not meeting  requirements embodied in  supervisory principles outlined above
  these actions may include intensifying  monitoring of  bank
 restricting  payment of  dividends
 requiring  bank to prepare and implement a satisfactory capital adequacy  restoration plan
 and requiring  bank to raise additional capital immediately
 supervisors  should have  discretion to use  tools best suited to  circumstances of  bank and  its operating environment
    760
    the permanent solution to banks difficulties is not always increased capital
  however
 some of  required measures 
such as improving systems and controls
 may  take a period of time to implement
 therefore
 increased capital might be used as an interim  measure while permanent measures to improve  banks position are being put in place
  once se permanent measures have been put in place and have been seen by  supervisors to be effective
  interim increase in capital requirements can be removed
          iii
    specific issues to be addressed under  supervisory review          process  761
     the committee has identified a number of important issues  banks and  supervisors should particularly focus on when carrying out  supervisory review process
  these issues include some key risks which are not directly addressed under pillar 1 and  important assessments  supervisors should make to ensure  proper functioning of  certain aspects of pillar 1
      a
      interest rate risk in  banking book  762
     the committee remains convinced  interest rate risk in  banking book is a  potentially significant risk which merits support from capital
 however
 comments received  from  industry and additional work conducted by  committee have made it clear   re is considerable heterogeneity across internationally active banks in terms of  nature  of  underlying risk and  processes for monitoring and managing it
 in light of this
   committee has concluded  it is at this time most appropriate to treat interest rate risk in   banking book under pillar 2 of  framework
 neverless
 supervisors who consider   re is sufficient homogeneity within ir banking populations regarding  nature and  methods for monitoring and measuring this risk could establish a mandatory minimum capital  requirement
    763
      the revised guidance on interest rate risk recognises banks internal systems as   principal tool for  measurement of interest rate risk in  banking book and   supervisory response
 to facilitate supervisors monitoring of interest rate risk exposures  across institutions
 banks would have to provide  results of ir internal measurement  systems
 expressed in terms of economic value relative to capital
 using a standardised  interest rate shock
  764
     if supervisors determine  banks are not holding capital commensurate with   level of interest rate risk
 y must require  bank to reduce its risk
 to hold a specific  additional amount of capital or some combination of  two
 supervisors should be  particularly attentive to  sufficiency of capital of outlier banks where economic value  declines by more than 20% of  sum of tier 1 and tier 2 capital as a result of a  standardised interest rate shock 
200 basis points
 or its equivalent
 as described in   supporting document principles for  management and supervision of interest rate risk
      b
       credit risk  1
       stress tests under  irb approaches  765
      a bank should ensure  it has sufficient capital to meet  pillar 1 requirements  and  results 
where a deficiency has been indicated
 of  credit risk stress test  performed as part of  pillar 1 irb minimum requirements 
paragraphs 434 to 437
""
  supervisors may wish to review how  stress test has been carried out
 the results of   stress test will thus contribute directly to  expectation  a bank will operate above   pillar 1 minimum regulatory capital ratios
 supervisors will consider wher a bank has  sufficient capital for se purposes
 to  extent  re is a shortfall
  supervisor will  react appropriately
" this will usually involve requiring  bank to reduce its risks and/or to  hold additional capital/provisions"
 so  existing capital resources could cover  pillar 1  requirements plus  result of a recalculated stress test
      2
       definition of default  766
"      a bank must use  reference definition of default for its internal estimations of pd  and/or lgd and ead"
 however
 as detailed in paragraph 454
 national supervisors will issue  guidance on how  reference definition of default is to be interpreted in ir jurisdictions
  supervisors will assess individual banks application of  reference definition of default and  its impact on capital requirements
 in particular
 supervisors will focus on  impact of  deviations from  reference definition according to paragraph 456 
use of external data or  historic internal data not fully consistent with  reference definition of default
""
      3
       residual risk  767
      the framework allows banks to offset credit or counterparty risk with collateral
  guarantees or credit derivatives
 leading to reduced capital charges
 while banks use credit  risk mitigation 
crm
 techniques to reduce ir credit risk
 se techniques give rise to  risks  may render  overall risk reduction less effective
 accordingly se risks 
""
  legal risk
 documentation risk
 or liquidity risk
 to which banks are exposed are of supervisory  concern
 where such risks arise
 and irrespective of fulfilling  minimum requirements set  out in pillar 1
 a bank could find itself with greater credit risk exposure to  underlying  counterparty than it had expected
 examples of se risks include
    inability to seize
 or realise in a timely manner
 collateral pledged 
on default of            counterparty
""
  refusal or delay by a guarantor to pay
 and  ineffectiveness of untested documentation
  768
     therefore
 supervisors will require banks to have in place appropriate written crm  policies and procedures in order to control se residual risks
 a bank may be required to  submit se policies and procedures to supervisors and must regularly review ir  appropriateness
 effectiveness and operation
  769
      in its crm policies and procedures
 a bank must consider wher
 when calculating  capital requirements
 it is appropriate to give  full recognition of  value of  credit risk  mitigant as permitted in pillar 1 and must demonstrate  its crm management policies  and procedures are appropriate to  level of capital benefit  it is recognising
 where  supervisors are not satisfied as to  robustness
 suitability or application of se policies  and procedures y may direct  bank to take immediate remedial action or hold  additional capital against residual risk until such time as  deficiencies in  crm  procedures are rectified to  satisfaction of  supervisor
 for example
 supervisors may  direct a bank to
    make adjustments to  assumptions on holding periods
 supervisory haircuts
 or           volatility 
in  own haircuts approach
""
  give less than full recognition of credit risk mitigants 
on  whole credit portfolio or           by specific product line
""
" and/or  hold a specific additional amount of capital"
    4
       credit concentration risk  770
     a risk concentration is any single exposure or group of exposures with  potential  to produce losses large enough 
relative to a banks capital
 total assets
 or overall risk level
  to threaten a banks health or ability to maintain its core operations
 risk concentrations are  arguably  single most important cause of major problems in banks
    771
     risk concentrations can arise in a banks assets
 liabilities
 or off-balance sheet  items
 through  execution or processing of transactions 
eir product or service
""
 or  through a combination of exposures across se broad categories
 because lending is   primary activity of most banks
 credit risk concentrations are often  most material risk  concentrations within a bank
    772
     credit risk concentrations
 by ir nature
 are based on common or correlated risk  factors
 which
 in times of stress
 have an adverse effect on  creditworthiness of each of   individual counterparties making up  concentration
 such concentrations are not  addressed in  pillar 1 capital charge for credit risk
    773
      banks should have in place effective internal policies
 systems and controls to  identify
 measure
 monitor
 and control ir credit risk concentrations
 banks should explicitly  consider  extent of ir credit risk concentrations in ir assessment of capital adequacy  under pillar 2
 these policies should cover  different forms of credit risk concentrations to  which a bank may be exposed
 such concentrations include
    significant exposures to an individual counterparty or group of related           counterparties
 in many jurisdictions
 supervisors define a limit for exposures of this           nature
 commonly referred to as a large exposure limit
 banks might also establish           an aggregate limit for  management and control of all of its large exposures as a           group
  credit exposures to counterparties in  same economic sector or geographic           region
  credit exposures to counterparties whose financial performance is dependent on            same activity or commodity
 and  indirect credit exposures arising from a banks crm activities 
""
 exposure to a           single collateral type or to credit protection provided by a single counterparty
""
  774
       a banks framework for managing credit risk concentrations should be clearly  documented and should include a definition of  credit risk concentrations relevant to   bank and how se concentrations and ir corresponding limits are calculated
 limits  should be defined in relation to a banks capital
 total assets or
 where adequate measures  exist
 its overall risk level
    775
    a banks management should conduct periodic stress tests of its major credit risk  concentrations and review  results of those tests to identify and respond to potential  changes in market conditions  could adversely impact  banks performance
    776
    a bank should ensure 
 in respect of credit risk concentrations
 it complies with   committee document principles for  management of credit risk 
september 2000
  and  more detailed guidance in  appendix to  paper
    777
     in  course of ir activities
 supervisors should assess  extent of a banks  credit risk concentrations
 how y are managed
 and  extent to which  bank  considers m in its internal assessment of capital adequacy under pillar 2
 such  assessments should include reviews of  results of a banks stress tests
 supervisors  should take appropriate actions where  risks arising from a banks credit risk  concentrations are not adequately addressed by  bank
      c
      operational risk  778
      gross income
 used in  basic indicator and standardised approaches for  operational risk
 is only a proxy for  scale of operational risk exposure of a bank and can  in some cases 
""
 for banks with low margins or profitability
 underestimate  need for  capital for operational risk
 with reference to  committee document on sound practices  for  management and supervision of operational risk 
february 2003
""
  supervisor  should consider wher  capital requirement generated by  pillar 1 calculation gives a  consistent picture of  individual banks operational risk exposure
 for example in  comparison with or banks of similar size and with similar operations
          iv
     or aspects of  supervisory review process  a
      supervisory transparency and accountability  779
      the supervision of banks is not an exact science
 and refore
 discretionary  elements within  supervisory review process are inevitable
 supervisors must take care to  carry out ir obligations in a transparent and accountable manner
 supervisors should  make publicly available  criteria to be used in  review of banks internal capital  assessments
 if a supervisor chooses to set target or trigger ratios or to set categories of  capital in excess of  regulatory minimum
 factors  may be considered in doing so  should be publicly available
 where  capital requirements are set above  minimum for  an individual bank
  supervisor should explain to  bank  risk characteristics specific  to  bank which resulted in  requirement and any remedial action necessary
      b
      enhanced cross-border communication and cooperation  780
    effective supervision of large banking organisations necessarily entails a close and  continuous dialogue between industry participants and supervisors
 in addition
   framework will require enhanced cooperation between supervisors
 on a practical basis
  especially for  cross-border supervision of complex international banking groups
    781
     the framework will not change  legal responsibilities of national supervisors for   regulation of ir domestic institutions or  arrangements for consolidated supervision  as set out in  existing basel committee standards
 the home country supervisor is  responsible for  oversight of  implementation of  framework for a banking group on  a consolidated basis
 host country supervisors are responsible for supervision of those  entities operating in ir countries
 in order to reduce  compliance burden and avoid  regulatory arbitrage
  methods and approval processes used by a bank at  group level  may be accepted by  host country supervisor at  local level
 provided  y  adequately meet  local supervisors requirements
 wherever possible
 supervisors should  avoid performing redundant and uncoordinated approval and validation work in order to  reduce  implementation burden on banks
 and conserve supervisory resources
    782
     in implementing  framework
 supervisors should communicate  respective  roles of home country and host country supervisors as clearly as possible to banking groups  with significant cross-border operations in multiple jurisdictions
 the home country supervisor  would lead this coordination effort in cooperation with  host country supervisors
 in  communicating  respective supervisory roles
 supervisors will take care to clarify   existing supervisory legal responsibilities remain unchanged
    783
      the committee supports a pragmatic approach of mutual recognition for  internationally active banks as a key basis for international supervisory co-operation
 this  approach implies recognising common capital adequacy approaches when considering   entities of internationally active banks in host jurisdictions
 as well as  desirability of  minimising differences in  national capital adequacy regulations between home and host  jurisdictions so  subsidiary banks are not subjected to excessive burden
          v
       supervisory review process for securitisation  784
      furr to  pillar 1 principle  banks should take account of  economic  substance of transactions in ir determination of capital adequacy
 supervisory authorities  will monitor
 as appropriate
 wher banks have done so adequately
 as a result
 regulatory  capital treatments for specific securitisation exposures might differ from those specified in  pillar 1 of  framework
 particularly in instances where  general capital requirement  would not adequately and sufficiently reflect  risks to which an individual banking  organisation is exposed
    785
      amongst or things
 supervisory authorities may review where relevant a banks  own assessment of its capital needs and how  has been reflected in  capital  calculation as well as  documentation of certain transactions to determine wher   capital requirements accord with  risk profile 
""
 substitution clauses
""
 supervisors will  also review  manner in which banks have addressed  issue of maturity mismatch in  relation to retained positions in ir economic capital calculations
 in particular
 y will be  vigilant in monitoring for  structuring of maturity mismatches in transactions to artificially  reduce capital requirements
 additionally
 supervisors may review  banks economic  capital assessment of actual correlation between assets in  pool and how y have  reflected  in  calculation
 where supervisors consider  a banks approach is not  adequate
 y will take appropriate action
 such action might include denying or reducing  capital relief in  case of originated assets
 or increasing  capital required against  securitisation exposures acquired
  a
       significance of risk transfer  786
     securitisation transactions may be carried out for purposes or than credit risk  transfer 
""
 funding
""
 where this is  case
 re might still be a limited transfer of credit  risk
 however
 for an originating bank to achieve reductions in capital requirements
  risk  transfer arising from a securitisation has to be deemed significant by  national supervisory  authority
 if  risk transfer is considered to be insufficient or non existent
  supervisory  authority can require  application of a higher capital requirement than prescribed under  pillar 1 or
 alternatively
 may deny a bank from obtaining any capital relief from   securitisations
 therefore
  capital relief  can be achieved will correspond to   amount of credit risk  is effectively transferred
 the following includes a set of examples  where supervisors may have concerns about  degree of risk transfer
 such as retaining or  repurchasing significant amounts of risk or cherry picking  exposures to be transferred  via a securitisation
    787
      retaining or repurchasing significant securitisation exposures
 depending on   proportion of risk held by  originator
 might undermine  intent of a securitisation to  transfer credit risk
 specifically
 supervisory authorities might expect  a significant portion  of  credit risk and of  nominal value of  pool be transferred to at least one  independent third party at inception and on an ongoing basis
 where banks repurchase risk  for market making purposes
 supervisors could find it appropriate for an originator to buy part  of a transaction but not
 for example
 to repurchase a whole tranche
 supervisors would  expect  where positions have been bought for market making purposes
 se positions  should be resold within an appropriate period
 reby remaining true to  initial intention  to  transfer risk
    788
      anor implication of realising only a non-significant risk transfer
 especially if  related to good quality unrated exposures
 is  both  poorer quality unrated assets and  most of  credit risk embedded in  exposures underlying  securitised transaction are  likely to remain with  originator
 accordingly
 and depending on  outcome of   supervisory review process
  supervisory authority may increase  capital requirement  for particular exposures or even increase  overall level of capital  bank is required to  hold
      b
       market innovations  789
     as  minimum capital requirements for securitisation may not be able to address  all potential issues
 supervisory authorities are expected to consider new features of  securitisation transactions as y arise
 such assessments would include reviewing   impact new features may have on credit risk transfer and
 where appropriate
 supervisors will  be expected to take appropriate action under pillar 2
 a pillar 1 response may be formulated  to take account of market innovations
" such a response may take  form of a set of  operational requirements and/or a specific capital treatment"
      c
       provision of implicit support  790
      support to a transaction
 wher contractual 
i
e
 credit enhancements provided at   inception of a securitised transaction
 or non-contractual 
implicit support
 can take  numerous forms
 for instance
 contractual support can include over collateralisation
 credit  derivatives
 spread accounts
 contractual recourse obligations
 subordinated notes
 credit  risk mitigants provided to a specific tranche
  subordination of fee or interest income or    deferral of margin income
 and clean-up calls  exceed 10 percent of  initial issuance
  examples of implicit support include  purchase of deteriorating credit risk exposures from   underlying pool
  sale of discounted credit risk exposures into  pool of securitised  credit risk exposures
  purchase of underlying exposures at above market price or an  increase in  first loss position according to  deterioration of  underlying exposures
    791
      the provision of implicit 
or non-contractual
 support
 as opposed to contractual  credit support 
i
e
 credit enhancements
""
 raises significant supervisory concerns
 for  traditional securitisation structures  provision of implicit support undermines  clean  break criteria
 which when satisfied would allow banks to exclude  securitised assets from  regulatory capital calculations
 for syntic securitisation structures
 it negates   significance of risk transference
 by providing implicit support
 banks signal to  market    risk is still with  bank and has not in effect been transferred
 the institutions capital  calculation refore understates  true risk
 accordingly
 national supervisors are  expected to take appropriate action when a banking organisation provides implicit support
    792
     when a bank has been found to provide implicit support to a securitisation
 it will be  required to hold capital against all of  underlying exposures associated with  structure  as if y had not been securitised
 it will also be required to disclose publicly  it was  found to have provided non-contractual support
 as well as  resulting increase in   capital charge 
as noted above
""
 the aim is to require banks to hold capital against  exposures for which y assume  credit risk
 and to discourage m from providing non
 contractual support
    793
    if a bank is found to have provided implicit support on more than one occasion
   bank is required to disclose its transgression publicly and national supervisors will take  appropriate action  may include
 but is not limited to
 one or more of  following
    the bank may be prevented from gaining favourable capital treatment on securitised           assets for a period of time to be determined by  national supervisor
  the bank may be required to hold capital against all securitised assets as though            bank had created a commitment to m
 by applying a conversion factor to            risk weight of  underlying assets
  for purposes of capital calculations
  bank may be required to treat all securitised           assets as if y remained on  balance sheet
  the bank may be required by its national supervisory authority to hold regulatory           capital in excess of  minimum risk-based capital ratios
  794
     supervisors will be vigilant in determining implicit support and will take appropriate  supervisory action to mitigate  effects
 pending any investigation
  bank may be  prohibited from any capital relief for planned securitisation transactions 
moratorium
""
  national supervisory response will be aimed at changing  banks behaviour with regard to   provision of implicit support
 and to correct market perception as to  willingness of   bank to provide future recourse beyond contractual obligations
      d
       residual risks  795
      as with credit risk mitigation techniques more generally
 supervisors will review   appropriateness of banks approaches to  recognition of credit protection
 in particular
  with regard to securitisations
 supervisors will review  appropriateness of protection  recognised against first loss credit enhancements
 on se positions
 expected loss is less  likely to be a significant element of  risk and is likely to be retained by  protection buyer  through  pricing
 therefore
 supervisors will expect banks policies to take account of this  in determining ir economic capital
 where supervisors do not consider  approach to  protection recognised is adequate
 y will take appropriate action
 such action may include  increasing  capital requirement against a particular transaction or class of transactions
  e
       call provisions  796
     supervisors expect a bank not to make use of clauses  entitles it to call   securitisation transaction or  coverage of credit protection prematurely if this would  increase  banks exposure to losses or deterioration in  credit quality of  underlying  exposures
    797
    besides  general principle stated above
 supervisors expect banks to only  execute clean-up calls for economic business purposes
 such as when  cost of servicing   outstanding credit exposures exceeds  benefits of servicing  underlying credit  exposures
    798
    subject to national discretion
 supervisory authorities may require a review prior to   bank exercising a call which can be expected to include consideration of
    the rationale for  banks decision to exercise  call
 and  the impact of  exercise of  call on  banks regulatory capital ratio
  799
     the supervisory authority may also require  bank to enter into a follow-up  transaction
 if necessary
 depending on  banks overall risk profile
 and existing market  conditions
    800
      date related calls should be set at a date no earlier than  duration or   weighted average life of  underlying securitisation exposures
 accordingly
 supervisory  authorities may require a minimum period to elapse before  first possible call date can be  set
 given
 for instance
  existence of up-front sunk costs of a capital market securitisation  transaction
      f
       early amortisation  801
     supervisors should review how banks internally measure
 monitor
 and manage  risks associated with securitisations of revolving credit facilities
 including an assessment of   risk and likelihood of early amortisation of such transactions
 at a minimum
 supervisors  should ensure  banks have implemented reasonable methods for allocating economic  capital against  economic substance of  credit risk arising from revolving securitisations  and should expect banks to have adequate capital and liquidity contingency plans   evaluate  probability of an early amortisation occurring and address  implications of  both scheduled and early amortisation
 in addition
  capital contingency plan should  address  possibility   bank will face higher levels of required capital under  early  amortisation pillar 1 capital requirement
    802
     because most early amortisation triggers are tied to excess spread levels
   factors affecting se levels should be well understood
 monitored
 and managed
 to   extent possible 
see paragraphs 790 to 794 on implicit support
""
 by  originating bank
 for  example
  following factors affecting excess spread should generally be considered
    interest payments made by borrowers on  underlying receivable balances
  or fees and charges to be paid by  underlying obligors 
""
 late-payment           fees
 cash advance fees
 over-limit fees
""
  gross charge-offs
  principal payments
  recoveries on charged-off loans
  interchange income
  interest paid on investors certificates
  macroeconomic factors such as bankruptcy rates
 interest rate movements
           unemployment rates
 etc
  803
     banks should consider  effects  changes in portfolio management or business  strategies may have on  levels of excess spread and on  likelihood of an early  amortisation event
 for example
 marketing strategies or underwriting changes  result in  lower finance charges or higher charge-offs
 might also lower excess spread levels and  increase  likelihood of an early amortisation event
    804
      banks should use techniques such as static pool cash collections analyses and  stress tests to better understand pool performance
 these techniques can highlight adverse  trends or potential adverse impacts
 banks should have policies in place to respond promptly  to adverse or unanticipated changes
 supervisors will take appropriate action where y do  not consider se policies adequate
 such action may include
 but is not limited to
 directing  a bank to obtain a dedicated liquidity line or raising  early amortisation credit conversion  factor
 thus
 increasing  banks capital requirements
    805
      while  early amortisation capital charge described in pillar 1 is meant to address  potential supervisory concerns associated with an early amortisation event
 such as   inability of excess spread to cover potential losses
  policies and monitoring described in  this section recognise  a given level of excess spread is not
 by itself
 a perfect proxy for  credit performance of  underlying pool of exposures
 in some circumstances
 for example
  excess spread levels may decline so rapidly as to not provide a timely indicator of underlying  credit deterioration
 furr
 excess spread levels may reside far above trigger levels
 but still  exhibit a high degree of volatility which could warrant supervisory attention
 in addition
  excess spread levels can fluctuate for reasons unrelated to underlying credit risk
 such as a  mismatch in  rate at which finance charges reprice relative to investor certificate rates
  routine fluctuations of excess spread might not generate supervisory concerns
 even when  y result in different capital requirements
 this is particularly  case as a bank moves in  or out of  first step of  early amortisation credit conversion factors
 on  or hand
  existing excess spread levels may be maintained by adding 
or designating
 an increasing  number of new accounts to  master trust
 an action  would tend to mask potential  deterioration in a portfolio
 for all of se reasons
 supervisors will place particular  emphasis on internal management
 controls
 and risk monitoring activities with respect to  securitisations with early amortisation features
    806
     supervisors expect   sophistication of a banks system in monitoring   likelihood and risks of an early amortisation event will be commensurate with  size and  complexity of  banks securitisation activities  involve early amortisation provisions
    807
    for controlled amortisations specifically
 supervisors may also review  process by  which a bank determines  minimum amortisation period required to pay down 90% of   outstanding balance at  point of early amortisation
 where a supervisor does not consider  this adequate it will take appropriate action
 such as increasing  conversion factor  associated with a particular transaction or class of transactions

 the third pillar  market discipline      i
       general considerations  a
       disclosure requirements  808
     the committee believes   rationale for pillar 3 is sufficiently strong to warrant   introduction of disclosure requirements for banks using  framework
 supervisors have  an array of measures  y can use to require banks to make such disclosures
 some of  se disclosures will be qualifying criteria for  use of particular methodologies or   recognition of particular instruments and transactions
      b
       guiding principles  809
      the purpose of pillar 3  market discipline is to complement  minimum capital  requirements 
pillar 1
 and  supervisory review process 
pillar 2
""
 the committee aims to  encourage market discipline by developing a set of disclosure requirements which will allow  market participants to assess key pieces of information on  scope of application
 capital
  risk exposures
 risk assessment processes
 and hence  capital adequacy of   institution
 the committee believes  such disclosures have particular relevance under   framework
 where reliance on internal methodologies gives banks more discretion in  assessing capital requirements
    810
     in principle
 banks disclosures should be consistent with how senior management  and  board of directors assess and manage  risks of  bank
 under pillar 1
" banks  use specified approaches/methodologies for measuring  various risks y face and   resulting capital requirements"
 the committee believes  providing disclosures  are  based on this common framework is an effective means of informing  market about a  banks exposure to those risks and provides a consistent and understandable disclosure  framework  enhances comparability
      c
       achieving appropriate disclosure  811
     the committee is aware  supervisors have different powers available to m to  achieve  disclosure requirements
 market discipline can contribute to a safe and sound  banking environment
 and supervisors require firms to operate in a safe and sound manner
  under safety and soundness grounds
 supervisors could require banks to disclose  information
 alternatively
 supervisors have  authority to require banks to provide  information in regulatory reports
 some supervisors could make some or all of   information in se reports publicly available
 furr
 re are a number of existing  mechanisms by which supervisors may enforce requirements
 these vary from country to  country and range from moral suasion through dialogue with  banks management 
in  order to change  latters behaviour
""
 to reprimands or financial penalties
 the nature of   exact measures used will depend on  legal powers of  supervisor and  seriousness  of  disclosure deficiency
 however
 it is not intended  direct additional capital  requirements would be a response to non-disclosure
 except as indicated below
    812
      in addition to  general intervention measures outlined above
  framework also  anticipates a role for specific measures
" where disclosure is a qualifying criterion under  pillar 1 to obtain lower risk weightings and/or to apply specific methodologies"
 re would  be  a direct sanction 
not being allowed to apply  lower weighting or  specific  methodology
""
  d
       interaction with accounting disclosures  813
     the committee recognises  need for a pillar 3 disclosure framework  does  not conflict with requirements under accounting standards
 which are broader in scope
 the  committee has made a considerable effort to see   narrower focus of pillar 3
 which is  aimed at disclosure of bank capital adequacy
 does not conflict with  broader accounting  requirements
 going forward
  committee intends to maintain an ongoing relationship  with   accounting authorities
 given  ir continuing work may have implications for   disclosures required in pillar 3
 the committee will consider future modifications to pillar 3 as  necessary in light of its ongoing monitoring of this area and industry developments
    814
     management should use its discretion in determining  appropriate medium and  location of  disclosure
 in situations where  disclosures are made under accounting  requirements or are made to satisfy listing requirements promulgated by securities  regulators
 banks may rely on m to fulfil  applicable pillar 3 expectations
 in se  situations
 banks should explain material differences between  accounting or or  disclosure and  supervisory basis of disclosure
 this explanation does not have to take   form of a line by line reconciliation
    815
      for those disclosures  are not mandatory under accounting or or  requirements
 management may choose to provide  pillar 3 information through or  means 
such as on a publicly accessible internet website or in public regulatory reports filed  with bank supervisors
""
 consistent with requirements of national supervisory authorities
  however
 institutions are encouraged to provide all related information in one location to   degree feasible
 in addition
 if information is not provided with  accounting disclosure
  institutions should indicate where  additional information can be found
    816
     the recognition of accounting or or mandated disclosure in this manner is also  expected to help clarify  requirements for validation of disclosures
 for example
  information in  annual financial statements would generally be audited and additional  material published with such statements must be consistent with  audited statements
 in  addition
 supplementary material 
such as managements discussion and analysis
  is  published to satisfy or disclosure regimes 
""
 listing requirements promulgated by  securities regulators
 is generally subject to sufficient scrutiny 
""
 internal control  assessments
 etc
""
 to satisfy  validation issue
 if material is not published under a  validation regime
 for instance in a stand alone report or as a section on a website
 n  management should ensure  appropriate verification of  information takes place
 in  accordance with  general disclosure principle set out below
 accordingly
 pillar 3  disclosures will not be required to be audited by an external auditor
 unless orwise  required by accounting standards setters
 securities regulators or or authorities
      e
       materiality  817
     a bank should decide which disclosures are relevant for it based on  materiality  concept
 information would be regarded as material if its omission or misstatement could  change or influence  assessment or decision of a user relying on  information for   purpose of making economic decisions
 this definition is consistent with international  accounting standards and with many national accounting frameworks
 the committee  recognises  need for a qualitative judgement of wher
 in light of  particular  circumstances
 a user of financial information would consider  item to be material 
user  test
""
 the committee is not setting specific thresholds for disclosure as se can be open to  manipulation and are difficult to determine
 and it believes   user test is a useful  benchmark for achieving sufficient disclosure
  f
           frequency  818
      the disclosures set out in pillar 3 should be made on a semi-annual basis
 subject  to  following exceptions
 qualitative disclosures  provide a general summary of a  banks risk management objectives and policies
 reporting system and definitions may be  published on an annual basis
 in recognition of  increased risk sensitivity of   framework and  general trend towards more frequent reporting in capital markets
 large  internationally active banks and or significant banks 
and ir significant bank  subsidiaries
 must disclose ir tier 1 and total capital adequacy ratios
 and ir  components
  on a quarterly basis
 furrmore
 if information on risk exposure or or  items is prone to rapid change
 n banks should also disclose information on a quarterly  basis
 in all cases
 banks should publish material information as soon as practicable and not  later than deadlines set by like requirements in national laws
       g
           proprietary and confidential information  819
      proprietary information encompasses information 
for example on products or  systems
""
"  if shared with competitors would render a banks investment in se  products/systems less valuable"
 and hence would undermine its competitive position
  information about customers is often confidential
 in  it is provided under  terms of a  legal agreement or counterparty relationship
 this has an impact on what banks should  reveal in terms of information about ir customer base
 as well as details on ir internal  arrangements
 for instance methodologies used
 parameter estimates
 data etc
 the  committee believes   requirements set out below strike an appropriate balance  between  need for meaningful disclosure and  protection of proprietary and  confidential  information
 in exceptional cases
 disclosure of certain items of information required by  pillar 3 may prejudice seriously  position of  bank by making public information  is  eir proprietary or confidential in nature
 in such cases
 a bank need not disclose those  specific items
 but must disclose more general information about  subject matter of   requirement
 toger with  fact 
 and  reason why
  specific items of  information  have not been disclosed
 this limited exemption is not intended to conflict with  disclosure  requirements under  accounting standards
          ii
          the disclosure requirements   820
      the following sections set out in tabular form  disclosure requirements under  pillar 3
 additional definitions and explanations are provided in a series of footnotes
      a
           general disclosure principle  821
    banks should have a formal disclosure policy approved by  board of directors   addresses  banks approach for determining what disclosures it will make and   internal controls over  disclosure process
 in addition
 banks should implement a process  for assessing  appropriateness of ir disclosures
 including validation and frequency of  m
      these components include tier 1 capital
 total capital and total required capital
  for some small banks with stable risk profiles
 annual reporting may be acceptable
 where a  bank publishes        information on only an annual basis
 it should state clearly why this is appropriate
  in this section of this framework
 disclosures marked with an asterisk are conditions for use  of a particular        approach or methodology for  calculation of regulatory capital
          b
           scope of application  822
      pillar 3 applies at  top consolidated level of  banking group to which   framework applies 
as indicated above in part 1
 scope of application
""
 disclosures related  to individual banks within  groups would not generally be required to fulfil  disclosure  requirements set out below
 an exception to this arises in  disclosure of total and tier 1  capital ratios by  top consolidated entity where an analysis of significant bank  subsidiaries within  group is appropriate

     an important part of  framework is  introduction of an irb approach for   assessment of regulatory capital for credit risk
 to varying degrees
 banks will have  discretion to use internal inputs in ir regulatory capital calculations
 in this sub-section
   irb approach is used as  basis for a set of disclosures intended to provide market  participants with information about asset quality
 in addition
 se disclosures are important  to allow market participants to assess  resulting capital in light of  exposures
 there  are two categories of quantitative disclosures
 those focussing on an analysis of risk  exposure and assessment 
i
e
  inputs
 and those focussing on  actual outcomes 
as   basis for providing an indication of  likely reliability of  disclosed information
""
  these are supplemented by a qualitative disclosure regime which provides background  information on  assumptions underlying  irb framework
  use of  irb system as  part of a risk management framework and  means for validating  results of  irb  system
 the disclosure regime is intended to enable market participants to assess  credit  risk exposure of irb banks and  overall application and suitability of  irb framework
  without revealing proprietary information or duplicating  role of  supervisor in  validating   detail of  irb framework in place

 it        might be expected  banks would provide se disclosures for as long run of data as  possible  for        example

      this annex is meant to clarify  calculation of  15% limit on innovative  instruments agreed by  committee in its press release of october 1998
    2
       innovative instruments will be limited to 15% of tier 1 capital
 net of goodwill
 to  determine  allowable amount of innovative instruments
 banks and supervisors should  multiply  amount of non-innovative tier 1 by 17
65%

    3
      as an example
 take a bank with 75 of common equity
 15 of non-cumulative  perpetual preferred stock
 5 of minority interest in  common equity account of a  consolidated subsidiary
 and 10 of goodwill
 the net amount of non-innovative tier 1 is  75
15
5-10 = 85
    4
        the allowable amount of innovative instruments this bank may include in tier 1  capital is 85x17
65% = 15
 if  bank issues innovative tier 1 instruments up to its limit
  total tier 1 will amount to 85 
 15 = 100
 the percentage of innovative instruments to  total tier 1 would equal 15%

       because supervisors will be responsible for assigning an eligible ecais credit risk  assessments to  risk weights available under  standardised approach
 y will need to  consider a variety of qualitative and quantitative factors to differentiate between  relative  degrees of risk expressed by each assessment
 such qualitative factors could include   pool of issuers  each agency covers
  range of ratings  an agency assigns
 each  ratings meaning
 and each agencys definition of default
 among ors
    2
       quantifiable parameters may help to promote a more consistent mapping of credit  risk assessments into  available risk weights under  standardised approach
 this  annex summarises  committees proposals to help supervisors with mapping exercises
  the parameters presented below are intended to provide guidance to supervisors and are  not intended to establish new or complement existing eligibility requirements for ecais
          evaluating cdrs
 two proposed measures  3
      to help ensure  a particular risk weight is appropriate for a particular credit risk  assessment
  committee recommends  supervisors evaluate  cumulative default  rate 
cdr
 associated with all issues assigned  same credit risk rating
 supervisors would  evaluate two separate measures of cdrs associated with each risk rating contained in   standardised approach
 using in both cases  cdr measured over a three-year period
    to ensure  supervisors have a sense of  long-run default experience over             time
 supervisors should evaluate  ten-year average of  three-year cdr when             this depth of data is available
  for new rating agencies or for those  have             compiled less than ten years of default data
 supervisors may wish to ask rating             agencies what y believe  10-year average of  three-year cdr would be for             each risk rating and hold m accountable for such an evaluation reafter for              purpose of risk weighting  claims y rate
  the or measure  supervisors should consider is  most recent three-year             cdr associated with each credit risk assessment of an ecai
  4
        both measurements would be compared to aggregate
 historical default rates of  credit risk assessments  were compiled by  committee and  are believed to  represent an equivalent level of credit risk
    5
      as three-year cdr data is expected to be available from ecais
 supervisors should  be able to compare  default experience of a particular ecais assessments with those  issued by or rating agencies
 in particular major agencies rating a similar population
          in 2002
 for example
 a supervisor would calculate  average of  three-year cdrs for  issuers assigned to      each rating grade 
 cohort
 for each of  ten years 1990-1999
  mapping risk ratings to risk weights using cdrs  6
        to help supervisors determine  appropriate risk weights to which an ecais risk  ratings should be mapped
 each of  cdr measures mentioned above could be compared  to  following reference and benchmark values of cdrs
    for each step in an ecais rating scale
 a ten-year average of  three-year cdr             would be compared to a long run reference three-year cdr  would represent a             sense of  long-run international default experience of risk assessments
  likewise
 for each step in  ecais rating scale
  two most recent three-year             cdr would be compared to benchmarks for cdrs
 this comparison would be             intended to determine wher  ecais most recent record of assessing credit             risk remains within  cdr supervisory benchmarks
  7
         table 1 below illustrates  overall framework for such comparisons
                                                        table 1                                      comparisons of cdr measures          international experience 
derived  from  combined experience of major rating agencies
             compare to                     external credit  assessment institution  set by  committee as guidance  calculated by national supervisors based on  ecais own default data  ten-year average of  three-year cdr  long-run reference cdr  cdr benchmarks  two most recent three-year cdr      1
         comparing an ecais long-run average three-year cdr to a long-run             reference cdr  8
       for each credit risk category used in  standardised approach of this framework
   corresponding long-run reference cdr would provide information to supervisors on what  its default experience has been internationally
 the ten-year average of an eligible ecais  particular assessment would not be expected to match exactly  long-run reference cdr
  the long run cdrs are meant as guidance for supervisors
 and not as targets  ecais  would have to meet
 the recommended long-run reference three-year cdrs for each of   committees credit risk categories are presented in table 2 below
 based on  committees  observations of  default experience reported by major rating agencies internationally
        it should be noted  each major rating agency would be subject to se comparisons as  well
 in which its       individual experience would be compared to  aggregate international experience

        comparing an ecais most recent three-year cdr to cdr benchmarks  9
       since an ecais own cdrs are not intended to match  reference cdrs exactly
  it is important to provide a better sense of what upper bounds of cdrs are acceptable for  each assessment
 and hence each risk weight
 contained in  standardised approach
    10
      it is  committees general sense   upper bounds for cdrs should serve as  guidance for supervisors and not necessarily as mandatory requirements
 exceeding   upper bound for a cdr would refore not necessarily require  supervisor to increase   risk weight associated with a particular assessment in all cases if  supervisor is  convinced   higher cdr results from some temporary cause or than weaker credit  risk assessment standards
    11
       to assist supervisors in interpreting wher a cdr falls within an acceptable range  for a risk rating to qualify for a particular risk weight
 two benchmarks would be set for each  assessment
 namely a monitoring level benchmark and a trigger level benchmark
      
a
       monitoring level benchmark  12
      exceeding  monitoring level cdr benchmark implies  a rating agencys  current default experience for a particular credit risk-assessment grade is markedly higher  than international default experience
 although such assessments would generally still be  considered eligible for  associated risk weights
 supervisors would be expected to consult  with  relevant ecai to understand why  default experience appears to be significantly  worse
 if supervisors determine   higher default experience is attributable to weaker  standards in assessing credit risk
 y would be expected to assign a higher risk category to   ecais credit risk assessment
      
b
       trigger level  13
      exceeding  trigger level benchmark implies  a rating agencys default  experience is considerably above  international historical default experience for a  particular assessment grade
 thus re is a presumption   ecais standards for  assessing credit risk are eir too weak or are not applied appropriately
 if  observed  three-year cdr exceeds  trigger level in two consecutive years
 supervisors would be  expected to move  risk assessment into a less favourable risk category
 however
 if  supervisors determine   higher observed cdr is not attributable to weaker  assessment standards
 n y may exercise judgement and retain  original risk  weight
     14
     in all cases where  supervisor decides to leave  risk category unchanged
 it  may wish to rely on pillar 2 of this framework and encourage banks to hold more capital  temporarily or to establish higher reserves
    15
     when  supervisor has increased  associated risk category
 re would be   opportunity for  assessment to again map to  original risk category if  ecai is able  to demonstrate  its three-year cdr falls and remains below  monitoring level for two  consecutive years
      
c
          calibrating  benchmark cdrs  16
      after reviewing a variety of methodologies
  committee decided to use monte  carlo simulations to calibrate both  monitoring and trigger levels for each credit risk  assessment category
 in particular
  proposed monitoring levels were derived from   99th percentile confidence interval and  trigger level benchmark from  99
9th percentile  confidence interval
 the simulations relied on publicly available historical default data from  major international rating agencies
 the levels derived for each risk assessment category are  presented in table 3 below
 rounded to  first decimal

 if supervisors determine   higher default experience is a temporary  phenomenon
 perhaps because it        reflects a temporary or exogenous shock such as a natural disaster
 n  risk weighting  proposed in  standardised        approach could still apply
 likewise
 a breach of  trigger level by several ecais  simultaneously may indicate a temporary        market change or exogenous shock as opposed to a loosening of credit standards
 in eir  scenario
 supervisors would be        expected to monitor  ecais assessments to ensure   higher default experience  is not  result of a loosening of        credit risk assessment standards

 calculating  effect of                 credit risk mitigation under supervisory formula      some examples are provided below for determining how collateral and guarantees are to be  recognised under  sf
          illustrative example involving collateral  proportional cover  assume an originating bank purchases a 100 securitisation exposure with a credit  enhancement level in excess of kirb for which an external or inferred rating is not available
  additionally
 assume   sf capital charge on  securitisation exposure is 1
6 
when  multiplied by 12
5 results in risk weighted assets of 20
""
 furr assume   originating  bank has received 80 of collateral in  form of cash  is denominated in  same  currency as  securitisation exposure
 the capital requirement for  position is  determined by multiplying  sf capital requirement by  ratio of adjusted exposure  amount and  original exposure amount
 as illustrated below
    step 1
 adjusted exposure amount         where 
based on  information provided above
""
    e
 is  exposure value after risk mitigation    e is current value of  exposure     he is haircut appropriate to  exposure 
this haircut is not relevant because  originating  bank is not lending  securitisation exposure in exchange for collateral
""
    c is  current value of  collateral received     hc is haircut appropriate to  collateral     hfx is haircut appropriate for mismatch between  collateral and exposure    step 2
 capital requirement  where 
based on  information provide above
""
      illustrative example involving a guarantee  proportional cover  all of  assumptions provided in  illustrative example involving collateral apply except  for   form of credit risk mitigant
 assume   bank has received an eligible
 unsecured  guarantee in  amount of 80 from a bank
 therefore
 a haircut for currency mismatch will  not apply
 the capital requirement is determined as follows
    the protected portion of  securitisation exposure 
80
 is to receive  risk           weight of  protection provider
 the risk weight for  protection provider is           equivalent to  for an unsecured loan to  guarantor bank
 as determined under            irb approach
 assume  this risk weight is 10%
 then
  capital charge on            protected portion would be
  0
64
  the capital charge for  unprotected portion 
20
 is derived by multiplying            capital charge on  securitisation exposure by  share of  unprotected portion           to  exposure amount
 the share of  unprotected portion is
" 20 / 100 = 20%"
           thus
  capital requirement will be
0
32
  the total capital requirement for  protected and unprotected portions is
    0
96 
          illustrative example   case of credit risk mitigants covering  most  senior parts  assume an originating bank  securitises a pool of loans of 1000
 the kirb of this  underlying pool is 5% 
capital charge of 50
""
 there is a first loss position of 20
 the  originator retains only  second most junior tranche
 an unrated tranche of 45
 we can  summarise  situation as follows
          1
       capital charge without collateral or guarantees  according to this example
  capital charge for  unrated retained tranche  is  straddling  kirb line is  sum of  capital requirements for tranches 
a
 and 
b
 in   graph above
    
a
      assume  sf risk weight for this subtranche is 820%
 thus
 risk-weighted assets           are  123
 capital charge is 9
84    
b
      the subtranche below kirb must be deducted
 risk-weighted assets            375
 capital charge of 30    total capital charge for  unrated straddling tranche 39
84  2
       capital charge with collateral  assume now   originating bank has received 25 of collateral in  form of cash   is denominated in  same currency as  securitisation exposure
 because  tranche is  straddling  kirb level
 we must assume   collateral is covering  most senior  subtranche above kirb 
""
a
 subtranche covered by 15 of collateral
 and
 only if re is  some collateral left
  coverage must be applied to  subtranche below kirb beginning  with  most senior portion 
""
 tranche 
b
 covered by 10 of collateral
""
 thus
 we have
        the capital requirement for  position is determined by multiplying  sf capital  requirement by  ratio of adjusted exposure amount and  original exposure amount
 as  illustrated below
 we must apply this for  two subtranches
    
a
      the first subtranche has an initial exposure of 15 and collateral of 15
 so in this           case it is completely covered
 in or words
    step 1
 adjusted exposure amount        where
    e
 is  exposure value after risk mitigation     e is current value of  exposure     c is  current value of  collateral received     he is haircut appropriate to  exposure 
not relevant here
 thus 0
    hc and hfx are haircut appropriate to  collateral and  for  mismatch between   collateral and exposure 
to simplify
    step 2
         
b
      the second subtranche has an initial exposure of 30 and collateral of 10
 which is            amount left after covering  subtranche above kirb
 thus
 se 10 must be           allocated to  most senior portion of  30 subtranche
    step1
 adjusted exposure amount          3
       guarantee  assume now  instead of collateral
  bank has received an eligible
 unsecured  guarantee in  amount of 25 from a bank
 therefore  haircut for currency mismatch will  not apply
 the situation can be summarised as
            the capital requirement for  two subtranches is determined as follows
    
a
      the first subtranche has an initial exposure of 15 and a guarantee of 15
 so in this           case it is completely covered
 the 15 will receive  risk weight of  protection           provider
 the risk weight for  protection provider is equivalent to  for an           unsecured loan to  guarantor bank
 as determined under  irb approach
           assume  this risk weight is 20%
    capital charge on  protected portion is  0
24    
b
      the second subtranche has an initial exposure of 30 and guarantee of 10 which  must be applied to  most senior portion of this subtranche
 accordingly
  protected part  is 10 and  unprotected part is 20
    again
  protected portion of  securitisation exposure is to receive  risk           weight of  guarantor bank
           capital charge on  protected portion is  0
16    the capital charge for  unprotected portion 
for an unrated position below kirb
 is          20    total capital charge for  unrated straddling tranche = 0

  principles for business line mapping   
a
          all activities must be mapped into  eight level 1 business lines in a mutually               exclusive and jointly exhaustive manner
    
b
          any banking or non-banking activity which cannot be readily mapped into                business line framework
 but which represents an ancillary function to an activity               included in  framework
 must be allocated to  business line it supports
 if more               than one business line is supported through  ancillary activity
 an objective               mapping criteria must be used
    
c
          when mapping gross income
 if an activity cannot be mapped into a particular               business line n  business line yielding  highest charge must be used
 the               same business line equally applies to any associated ancillary activity
    
d
          banks may use internal pricing methods to allocate gross income between business               lines provided  total gross income for  bank 
as would be recorded under                basic indicator approach
 still equals  sum of gross income for  eight business               lines
    
e
          the mapping of activities into business lines for operational risk capital purposes               must be consistent with  definitions of business lines used for regulatory capital               calculations in or risk categories
 i
e
 credit and market risk
 any deviations from               this principle must be clearly motivated and documented
    
f
          the mapping process used must be clearly documented
 in particular
 written               business line definitions must be clear and detailed enough to allow third parties to               replicate  business line mapping
 documentation must
 among or things
               clearly motivate any exceptions or overrides and be kept on record
    
g
          processes must be in place to define  mapping of any new activities or products
        supplementary business line mapping guidance        there are a variety of valid approaches  banks can use to map ir activities to   eight business lines
        provided  approach used meets  business line mapping principles
 neverless
   committee is        aware  some banks would welcome furr guidance
 the following is refore an  example of one        possible approach  could be used by a bank to map its gross income
        gross income for retail banking consists of net interest income on loans and advances to  retail customers and        smes treated as retail
 plus fees related to traditional retail activities
 net income from  swaps and derivatives        held to hedge  retail banking book
 and income on purchased retail receivables
 to  calculate net interest        income for retail banking
 a bank takes  interest earned on its loans and advances to  retail customers less         weighted average cost of funding of  loans 
from whatever source  retail or or  deposits
""
        similarly
 gross income for commercial banking consists of  net interest income on loans  and advances to        corporate 
plus smes treated as corporate
""
 interbank and sovereign customers and  income on purchased        corporate receivables
 plus fees related to traditional commercial banking activities  including commitments

 bills of exchange
 net income 
""
 from coupons and dividends
 on securities  held in  banking        book
" and profits/losses on swaps and derivatives held to hedge  commercial banking  book"
 again
         calculation of net interest income is based on interest earned on loans and advances to  corporate
 interbank        and sovereign customers less  weighted average cost of funding for se loans 
from  whatever source
""
        for trading and sales
" gross income consists of profits/losses on instruments held for  trading purposes "

e
 in         mark-to-market book
""
 net of funding cost
 plus fees from wholesale broking
        for  or five business lines

" payment and settlement consists of fees to cover provision of  payment/settlement        facilities for wholesale counterparties"

""
 for  collateralised transactions generally determine  treatment under both  standardised  and  foundation internal ratings-based 
irb
 approaches for claims in  banking book   are secured by financial collateral of sufficient quality
 banks using  advanced irb  approach will typically take financial collateral on banking book exposures into account by  using ir own internal estimates to adjust  exposures loss given default 
lgd
""
 one  exception for a bank using  advanced irb approach pertains to  recognition of repo
 style transactions subject to a master netting agreement
 as discussed below
    2
       collateralised exposures  take  form of repo-style transactions 
i
e
"  repo/reverse repos and securities lending/borrowing"
 are subject to special considerations
  such transactions  are held in  trading book are subject to a counterparty risk capital  charge as described below
 furr
 all banks
 including those using  advanced irb  approach
 must follow  methodology in  crm section
 which is outlined below
 for  repo-style transactions booked in eir  banking book or trading book  are subject to  master netting agreements if y wish to recognise  effects of netting for capital  purposes
          standardised and foundation irb approaches  3
       banks under  standardised approach may use eir  simple approach or   comprehensive approach for determining  appropriate risk weight for a transaction  secured by eligible financial collateral
 under  simple approach
  risk weight of   collateral substitutes for  of  counterparty
 apart from a few types of very low risk  transactions
  risk weight floor is 20%
 under  foundation irb approach
 banks may  only use  comprehensive approach
    4
       under  comprehensive approach
 eligible financial collateral reduces  amount  of  exposure to  counterparty
 the amount of  collateral is decreased and
 where  appropriate
  amount of  exposure is increased through  use of haircuts
 to account  for potential changes in  market prices of securities and foreign exchange rates over   holding period
 this results in an adjusted exposure amount
 e
""
 banks may eir use  supervisory haircuts set by  committee or
 subject to qualifying criteria
 rely on ir own  estimates of haircuts
 where  supervisory holding period for calculating  haircut  amounts differs from  holding period set down in  rules for  type of collateralised  transaction
  haircuts are to be scaled up or down as appropriate
 once e
 is calculated
   standardised bank will assign  amount a risk weight appropriate to  counterparty
  for transactions secured by financial collateral or than repos subject to a master netting  agreement
 foundation irb banks are to use e
 to adjust  lgd on  exposure
  special considerations for repo-style transactions  5
       repo-style transactions booked in  trading book
 will
 like otc derivatives held in   trading book
 be subject to a counterparty credit risk charge
 in calculating this charge
 a  bank under  standardised approach must use  comprehensive approach to collateral
   simple approach will not be available
    6
        the capital treatment for repo-style transactions  are not subject to master  netting agreements is  same as  for or collateralised transactions
 however
 for  banks using  comprehensive approach
 national supervisors have  discretion to  determine  a haircut of zero may be used where  transaction is with a core market  participant and meets certain or criteria 
so-called carve-out treatment
""
 where repo-style  transactions are subject to a master netting agreement wher y are held in  banking  book or trading book
 a bank may choose not to recognise  netting effects in calculating  capital
 in  case
 each transaction will be subject to a capital charge as if re were no  master netting agreement
    7
         if a bank wishes to recognise  effects of master netting agreements on repo-style  transactions for capital purposes
 it must apply  treatment  crm section sets forth in   regard on a counterparty-by-counterparty basis
 this treatment would apply to all repo
 style transactions subject to master netting agreements
 regardless of wher  bank is  under  standardised
 foundation irb
 or advanced irb approach and regardless of  wher  transactions are held in  banking or trading book
 under this treatment
   bank would calculate e
 as  sum of  net current exposure on  contract plus an add
 on for potential changes in security prices and foreign exchange rates
 the add-on may be  determined through  supervisory haircuts or
 for those banks  meet  qualifying  criteria
 own estimate haircuts or an internal var model
 the carve-out treatment for haircuts  on repo-style transactions may not be used where an internal var model is applied

 re may be or ways of determining  different treatments  applicable to       different types of pses

   administrative bodies responsible to central governments
 regional governments or to local       authorities and or non-commercial undertakings owned by  governments or local  authorities may       not warrant  same treatment as claims on ir sovereign if  entities do not have  revenue raising powers       or or arrangements as described above
 if strict lending rules apply to se entities and  a declaration of       bankruptcy is not possible because of ir special public status
 it may be appropriate to  treat se claims in        same manner as claims on banks
    commercial undertakings owned by central governments
 regional governments or by local  authorities might       be treated as normal commercial enterprises
 however
 if se entities function as a  corporate in competitive       markets even though  state

 implement and improve systems  for tracking and monitoring  credit risk exposure arising from unsettled transactions as  appropriate for producing management information  facilitates action on a timely basis

          ii
     credit risk mitigation  a
      overarching issues  1
      introduction  32
     banks use a number of techniques to mitigate  credit risks to which y are  exposed
 exposure may be collateralised in whole or in part with cash or securities
 or a loan  exposure may be guaranteed by a third party
    33
      where se various techniques meet  operational requirements below credit risk  mitigation 
crm
 may be recognised
      2
      general remarks  34
     the framework set out in this section is applicable to  banking book exposures  under  simplified standardised approach
    35
     no transaction in which crm techniques are used should receive a higher capital  requirement than an orwise identical transaction where such techniques are not used
    36
      the effects of crm will not be double counted
 therefore
 no additional supervisory  recognition of crm for regulatory capital purposes will be granted on claims for which an  issue-specific rating is used  already reflects  crm
 principal-only ratings will also not  be allowed within  framework of crm
    37
      although banks use crm techniques to reduce ir credit risk
 se techniques  give rise to risks 
residual risks
 which may render  overall risk reduction less effective
  where se risks are not adequately controlled
 supervisors may impose additional capital  charges or take or supervisory actions as detailed in pillar 2
    38
      while  use of crm techniques reduces or transfers credit risk
 it simultaneously  may increase or risks to  bank
 such as legal
 operational
 liquidity and market risks
  therefore
 it is imperative  banks employ robust procedures and processes to control  se risks
 including strategy
 consideration of  underlying credit
 valuation
 policies and  procedures
 systems
 control of roll-off risks
 and management of concentration risk arising  from  banks use of crm techniques and its interaction with  banks overall credit risk  profile
    39
      the pillar 3 requirements must also be observed for banks to obtain capital relief in  respect of any crm techniques
      3
          legal certainty  40
       in order for banks to obtain capital relief
 all documentation used in collateralised  transactions and for documenting guarantees must be binding on all parties and legally  enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions
 banks must have conducted sufficient legal review to  verify this and have a well founded legal basis to reach this conclusion
 and undertake such  furr review as necessary to ensure continuing enforceability
      4
          proportional cover  41
        where  amount collateralised or guaranteed 
or against which credit protection is  held
 is less than  amount of  exposure
 and  secured and unsecured portions are  of equal seniority
 i
e
  bank and  guarantor share losses on a pro-rata basis
 capital  relief will be afforded on a proportional basis
 i
e
  protected portion of  exposure will  receive  treatment applicable to  collateral or counterparty
 with  remainder treated  as unsecured
      b
          collateralised transactions  42
         a collateralised transaction is one in which
    banks have a credit exposure or potential credit exposure
 and   credit exposure or potential credit exposure is hedged in whole or in part by              collateral posted by  counterparty  or by a third party on behalf of               counterparty
                 in this section counterparty is used to denote a party to whom a bank has an on
or off- balance sheet credit       exposure or a potential credit exposure
 that exposure may
 for example
 take  form of  a loan of cash or       securities 
where  counterparty would traditionally be called  borrower
""
 of securities  posted as       collateral
 of a commitment or of exposure under an otc derivative contract
  43
      under  simplified standardised approach
 only  simple approach from   standardised approach will apply
 which
 similar to  1988 accord
 substitutes  risk  weighting of  collateral for  risk weighting of  counterparty for  collateralised  portion of  exposure 
generally subject to a 20% floor
""
 partial collateralisation is  recognised
 mismatches in  maturity or currency of  underlying exposure and   collateral will not be allowed
      1
          minimum conditions  44
       in addition to  general requirements for legal certainty set out in paragraph 40
   following operational requirements must be met
    45
     the collateral must be pledged for at least  life of  exposure and it must be  marked to market and revalued with a minimum frequency of six months
    46
      in order for collateral to provide protection
  credit quality of  counterparty and   value of  collateral must not have a material positive correlation
 for example
  securities issued by  counterparty  or by any related group entity  would provide little  protection and so would be ineligible
    47
      the bank must have clear and robust procedures for  timely liquidation of  collateral
    48
     where  collateral is held by a custodian
 banks must take reasonable steps to  ensure   custodian segregates  collateral from its own assets
    49
       where a bank
 acting as agent
 arranges a repo-style transaction

e
"  repurchase/reverse repurchase and securities lending/borrowing transactions"

 certificates of deposit or comparable instruments issued by   lending bank are held       as collateral at a third-party bank in a non-custodial arrangement
" if y are openly  pledged/assigned to        lending bank and if  pledge/assignment is unconditional and irrevocable"
  exposure  amount covered by        collateral 
after any necessary haircuts for currency risk

      risk weights  51
      those portions of claims collateralised by  market value of recognised collateral  receive  risk weight applicable to  collateral instrument
 the risk weight on   collateralised portion will be subject to a floor of 20%
 the remainder of  claim should be  assigned to  risk weight appropriate to  counterparty
 a capital requirement will be  applied to banks on eir side of  collateralised transaction
 for example
 both repos and  reverse repos will be subject to capital requirements
    52
    the 20% floor for  risk weight on a collateralised transaction will not be applied  and a 0% risk weight can be provided where  exposure and  collateral are  denominated in  same currency
 and eir
     collateral is cash on deposit

       credit risk  securitisation framework  a
         scope of transactions covered under  securitisation framework  61
       a traditional securitisation is a structure where  cash flow from an underlying pool  of exposures is used to service at least two different stratified risk positions or tranches  reflecting different degrees of credit risk
 payments to  investors depend upon   performance of  specified underlying exposures
 as opposed to being derived from an  obligation of  entity originating those exposures
" the stratified/tranched structures          this includes  bank for international settlements"
  international monetary fund
   european central       bank and  european community
"  characterise securitisations differ from ordinary senior/subordinated debt instruments in   junior securitisation tranches can absorb losses without interrupting contractual payments to  more senior tranches"
" whereas subordination in a senior/subordinated debt structure is a  matter of priority of rights to  proceeds of a liquidation"
    62
         banks exposures to securitisation are referred to as securitisation exposures
      b
          permissible role of banks  63
      a bank operating under  simplified standardised approach can only assume   role of an investing bank in a traditional securitisation
 an investing bank is an institution
  or than  originator or  servicer  assumes  economic risk of a securitisation  exposure
    64
        a bank is considered to be an originator if it originates directly or indirectly credit  exposures included in  securitisation
 a servicer bank is one  manages  underlying  credit exposures of a securitisation on a day-to-day basis in terms of collection of principal  and interest
 which is n forwarded to investors in securitisation exposures
 a bank under   simplified standardised approach should not offer credit enhancement
 liquidity facilities  or or financial support to a securitisation

          treatment of securitisation exposures  65
      banks using  simplified standardised approach to credit risk for  type of  underlying exposure
s
 securitised are permitted to use a simplified version of   standardised approach under  securitisation framework
    66
       the standard risk weight for securitisation exposures for an investing bank will be  100%
 for first loss positions acquired
 deduction from capital will be required
 the deduction  will be taken 50% from tier 1 and 50% from tier 2 capital

         operational risk  67
     the simplified standardised approach for operational risk is  basic indicator  approach under which banks must hold capital equal to a fixed percentage 
15%
 of average  annual gross income
 where positive
 over  previous three years
    68
       gross income is defined as net interest income plus net non-interest income
 it is  intended  this measure should
 
i
 be gross of any provisions 
""
 for unpaid interest
""
  
ii
 be gross of operating expenses
 including fees paid to outsourcing service providers
"                  as defined by national supervisors and/or national accounting standards"
         in contrast to fees paid for services  are outsourced
 fees received by banks  provide  outsourcing       services shall be included in  definition of gross income
  
iii
" exclude realised profits/losses from  sale of securities in  banking book"
 and 
iv
  exclude extraordinary or irregular items as well as income derived from insurance
    69
     banks using this approach are encouraged to comply with  committees  guidance on sound practices for  management and supervision of operational risk
