 toger with  document basel iii
 international framework for liquidity   risk measurement
 standards and monitoring
 presents  basel committee  reforms to  strengn   global capital and liquidity rules with  goal of promoting a more resilient banking sector
  the   objective of  reforms is to improve  banking sector  ability to absorb shocks arising  from   financial and economic stress
 whatever  source
 thus reducing  risk of spillover from     financial sector to  real economy
 this document sets out  rules text and timelines to   implement  basel iii framework
    2
    the committee  comprehensive reform package addresses  lessons of  financial  crisis
   through its reform package
  committee also aims to improve risk management and  governance as   well as strengn banks transparency and disclosures
 moreover
  reform package  includes    committee  efforts to strengn  resolution of systemically significant cross-border banks
     3
    a strong and resilient banking system is  foundation for sustainable economic growth
  as   banks are at  centre of  credit intermediation process between savers and investors
   moreover
 banks provide critical services to consumers
 small and medium-sized enterprises
  large   corporate firms and governments who rely on m to conduct ir daily business
 both at a   domestic and international level
    4
    one of  main reasons  economic and financial crisis
 which began in 2007
 became  so   severe was   banking sectors of many countries had built up excessive on
and off- balance   sheet leverage
 this was accompanied by a gradual erosion of  level and quality of   capital   base
 at  same time
 many banks were holding insufficient liquidity buffers
 the banking  system   refore was not able to absorb  resulting systemic trading and credit losses nor could it  cope   with  reintermediation of large off-balance sheet exposures  had built up in  shadow   banking system
 the crisis was furr amplified by a procyclical deleveraging process and by     interconnectedness of systemic institutions through an array of complex transactions
 during     most severe episode of  crisis
  market lost confidence in  solvency and liquidity of  many   banking institutions
 the weaknesses in  banking sector were rapidly transmitted to   rest of    financial system and  real economy
 resulting in a massive contraction of liquidity and   credit availability
 ultimately  public sector had to step in with unprecedented injections of   liquidity
 capital support and guarantees
 exposing taxpayers to large losses

  these efforts include  basel committee  recommendations to strengn national  resolution   powers and ir cross-border implementation
 the basel committee mandated its cross- border bank   resolution group to report on  lessons from  crisis
 on recent changes and adaptations  of   national frameworks for cross
border resolutions

    the effect on banks
 financial systems and economies at  epicentre of  crisis was   immediate
 however
  crisis also spread to a wider circle of countries around  globe
 for   se countries  transmission channels were less direct
 resulting from a severe contraction  in   global liquidity
 cross-border credit availability and demand for exports
 given  scope and   speed with which  recent and previous crises have been transmitted around  globe as  well as    unpredictable nature of future crises
 it is critical  all countries raise  resilience   of ir banking sectors to both internal and external shocks
    6
    to address  market failures revealed by  crisis
  committee is introducing a  number   of fundamental reforms to  international regulatory framework
 the reforms strengn   bank-level
 or microprudential
 regulation
 which will help raise  resilience of individual   banking institutions to periods of stress
 the reforms also have a macroprudential focus
   addressing system-wide risks  can build up across  banking sector as well as     procyclical  amplification  of  se  risks  over  time
  clearly  se  micro  and   macroprudential approaches to supervision are interrelated
 as greater resilience at   individual   bank level reduces  risk of system-wide shocks
        a
   strengning  global capital framework  7
    the basel committee  is raising  resilience  of  banking  sector by strengning    regulatory capital framework
 building on  three pillars of  basel il framework
 the  reforms   raise both  quality and quantity of  regulatory capital base and enhance  risk  coverage of    capital framework
 they are underpinned by a leverage ratio  serves as a backstop to     risk-based capital measures
 is intended to constrain excess leverage in  banking system  and   provide an extra layer of protection against model risk and measurement error
 finally
    committee is introducing a number of macroprudential elements into  capital framework  to help   contain systemic risks arising from procyclicality and from  interconnectedness of financial   institutions
      1
   raising  quality
 consistency and transparency of  capital base  8
    it is critical  banks risk exposures are backed by a high quality capital base
 the   crisis demonstrated  credit losses and writedowns come out of retained earnings
 which  is part   of banks tangible common equity base
 it also revealed  inconsistency in  definition of   capital across jurisdictions and  lack of disclosure  would have enabled  market to  fully   assess and compare  quality of capital between institutions
    9
    to this end
  predominant form of tier 1 capital must be common shares and retained   earnings
 this standard is reinforced through a set of principles  also can be tailored to    context of non-joint stock companies to ensure y hold comparable levels of high quality  tier 1   capital
 deductions from capital and prudential filters have been harmonised internationally  and   generally applied at  level of common equity or its equivalent in  case of non-joint stock   companies
 the remainder of  tier 1 capital base must be comprised of instruments   are   subordinated
 have fully discretionary non
cumulative dividends or coupons and have neir  a   maturity date nor an incentive to redeem
 innovative hybrid capital instruments with an  incentive   to redeem through features such as step-up clauses
 currently limited to 15% of  tier 1  capital   base
 will be phased out
 in addition
 tier 2 capital instruments will be harmonised and so- called   tier 3 capital instruments
 which were only available to cover market risks
 eliminated
 finally
   to improve market discipline
  transparency of  capital base will be improved
 with all   elements of capital required to be disclosed along with a detailed reconciliation to   reported   accounts
        10
   the committee is introducing se changes in a manner  minimises  disruption  to   capital instruments  are currently outstanding
 it also continues to review  role    contingent capital should play in  regulatory capital framework
      2
   enhancing risk coverage  11
   one of  key lessons of  crisis has been  need to strengn  risk coverage of     capital framework
 failure to capture major on
and off-balance sheet risks
 as well as  derivative   related exposures
 was a key destabilising factor during  crisis
    12
   in response to se shortcomings
  committee in july 2009 completed a number of  critical   reforms to  basel il framework
 these reforms will raise capital requirements for  trading   book and complex securitisation exposures
 a major source of losses for many internationally  active   banks
 the enhanced treatment introduces a stressed value-at-risk 
var
 capital requirement  based   on a continuous 12-month period of significant financial stress
 in addition
  committee  has   introduced higher capital requirements for so-called resecuritisations in both  banking and     trading book
 the reforms also raise  standards of  pillar 2 supervisory review process  and   strengn pillar 3 disclosures
 the pillar 1 and pillar 3 enhancements must be implemented  by    end of 2011
  pillar 2 standards became effective when y were introduced in july 2009
  the   committee is also conducting a fundamental review of  trading book
 the work on   fundamental   review of  trading book is targeted for completion by year-end 2011
    13
   this document also introduces measures to strengn  capital requirements for   counterparty credit exposures arising from banks derivatives
 repo and securities financing   activities
 these reforms will raise  capital buffers backing se exposures
 reduce   procyclicality and provide additional incentives to move otc derivative contracts to central   counterparties
 thus helping reduce systemic risk across  financial system
 they also  provide   incentives to strengn  risk management of counterparty credit exposures
    14
   to this end
  committee is introducing  following reforms
    
a
   going forward
 banks must determine ir capital requirement for counterparty credit  risk   using stressed inputs
 this will address concerns about capital charges becoming too low  during   periods of compressed market volatility and help address procyclicality
 the approach
 which  is   similar to what has been introduced for market risk
 will also promote more integrated  management   of market and counterparty credit risk
    
b
   banks will be subject to a capital charge for potential mark-to-market losses 
ie credit   valuation adjustment  cva  risk
 associated with a deterioration in  credit worthiness  of a   counterparty
 while  basel il standard covers  risk of a counterparty default
 it does not   address such cva risk
 which during  financial crisis was a greater source of losses than  those   arising from outright defaults
    
c
   the committee is strengning standards for collateral management and initial  margining
   banks with large and illiquid derivative exposures to a counterparty will have to apply longer   margining periods as a basis for determining  regulatory capital requirement
 additional   standards have been adopted to strengn collateral risk management practices
    
d
   to address  systemic risk arising from  interconnectedness of banks and or  financial   institutions through  derivatives markets
  committee is supporting  efforts of    committee on payments and settlement systems 
cpss
 and  international organization  of securities commissions 
iosco
 to establish strong standards for   financial market infrastructures
 including central counterparties
 the capitalisation of bank   exposures to central counterparties 
ccps
 will be based in part on  compliance of  ccp  with   such standards
 and will be finalised after a consultative process in 2011
 a bank  collateral  and   mark-to-market exposures to ccps meeting se enhanced principles will be subject to a low  risk   weight
 proposed at 2%
 and default fund exposures to ccps will be subject to risk-sensitive   capital requirements
 these criteria
 toger with strengned capital requirements for  bilateral   otc derivative exposures
 will create strong incentives for banks to move exposures to such  ccps
   moreover
 to address systemic risk within  financial sector
  committee also is raising     risk weights on exposures to financial institutions relative to  non-financial corporate  sector
   as financial exposures are more highly correlated than non-financial ones
    
e
   the committee is raising counterparty credit risk management standards in a number of  areas
   including for  treatment of so-called wrong-way risk
 ie cases where  exposure increases  when    credit quality of  counterparty deteriorates
 it also issued final additional guidance for    sound backtesting of counterparty credit exposures
    15
   finally
  committee assessed a number of measures to mitigate  reliance on  external   ratings of  basel il framework
 the measures include requirements for banks to perform  ir own   internal assessments of externally rated securitisation exposures
  elimination of certain   cliff effects associated with credit risk mitigation practices
 and  incorporation of key   elements of  iosco code of conduct fundamentals for credit rating agencies into   committee    eligibility criteria for  use of external ratings in  capital framework
 the committee also   is conducting a more fundamental review of  securitisation framework
 including its  reliance on   external ratings
      3
   supplementing  risk-based capital requirement with a leverage ratio  16
   one of  underlying features of  crisis was  build up of excessive on
and   off-balance sheet leverage in  banking system
 the build up of leverage also has been a  feature   of previous financial crises
 for example leading up to september 1998
 during  most severe  part   of  crisis
  banking sector was forced by  market to reduce its leverage in a manner     amplified downward pressure on asset prices
 furr exacerbating  positive feedback loop   between losses
 declines in bank capital
 and  contraction in credit availability
 the  committee   refore is introducing a leverage ratio requirement  is intended to achieve  following   objectives
        constrain leverage in  banking sector
 thus helping to mitigate  risk of    destabilising deleveraging processes which can damage  financial system and  economy
  and      introduce additional safeguards against model risk and measurement error by  supplementing    risk-based measure with a simple
 transparent
 independent measure of risk
  17
   the leverage ratio is calculated in a comparable manner across jurisdictions
 adjusting for   any differences in accounting standards
 the committee has designed  leverage ratio to be  a   credible supplementary measure to  risk-based requirement with a view to migrating to a  pillar 1   treatment based on appropriate review and calibration
        4
   reducing procyclicality and promoting countercyclical buffers  18
   one of  most destabilising elements of  crisis has been  procyclical amplification   of financial shocks throughout  banking system
 financial markets and  broader  economy
 the   tendency of market participants to behave in a procyclical manner has been amplified through  a   variety of channels
 including through accounting standards for both mark-to-market assets  and   held-to-maturity loans
 margining practices
 and through  build up and release of leverage  among   financial institutions
 firms
 and consumers
 the basel committee is introducing a number of   measures to make banks more resilient to such procyclical dynamics
 these measures will help  ensure     banking sector serves as a shock absorber
 instead of a transmitter of risk to    financial system and broader economy
    19
   in addition to  leverage ratio discussed in  previous section
  committee is   introducing a series of measures to address procyclicality and raise  resilience of   banking   sector in good times
 these measures have  following key objectives
    dampen any excess cyclicality of  minimum capital requirement
  promote more forward looking provisions
  conserve capital to build buffers at individual banks and  banking sector  can be used  in stress
 and  achieve  broader macroprudential goal of protecting  banking sector from periods of   excess credit growth
    cyclicality of  minimum requirement  20
   the basel il framework increased  risk sensitivity and coverage of  regulatory capital   requirement
 indeed
 one of  most procyclical dynamics has been  failure of risk  management   and capital frameworks to capture key exposures  such as complex trading activities
   resecuritisations and exposures to off-balance sheet vehicles  in advance of  crisis
  however
   it is not possible to achieve greater risk sensitivity across institutions at a given point in time   without introducing a certain degree of cyclicality in minimum capital requirements over time
  the   committee was aware of this trade-off during  design of  basel il framework and  introduced a   number of safeguards to address excess cyclicality of  minimum requirement
 they include     requirement to use long term data horizons to estimate probabilities of default
   introduction   of so called downturn loss-given-default 
lgd
 estimates and  appropriate calibration of     risk functions
 which convert loss estimates into regulatory capital requirements
 the  committee   also required  banks conduct stress tests  consider  downward migration of ir  credit   portfolios in a recession
    21
   in addition
  committee has put in place a comprehensive data collection initiative to   assess  impact of  basel il framework on its member countries over  credit cycle
  should    cyclicality of  minimum requirement be greater than supervisors consider appropriate
     committee will consider additional measures to dampen such cyclicality
    22
   the committee has reviewed a number of additional measures  supervisors could  take to   achieve a better balance between risk sensitivity and  stability of capital requirements
  should   this be viewed as necessary
 in particular
  range of possible measures includes an  approach by    committee of european banking supervisors 
cebs
 to use  pillar 2 process to adjust  for    compression of probability of default 
pd
              estimates in internal ratings-based 
irb
 capital requirements during benign credit conditions  by   using  pd estimates for a bank  portfolios in downturn conditions
 addressing  same  issue
    uk financial services authority 
fsa
 has proposed an approach aimed at providing non- cyclical   pds in irb requirements through  application of a scalar  converts  outputs of a  bank    underlying pd models into through--cycle estimates
    forward looking provisioning  23
   the committee is promoting stronger provisioning practices through three related  initiatives
   first
 it is advocating a change in  accounting standards towards an expected loss 
el
   approach
 the committee strongly supports  initiative of  iasb to move to an el  approach
 the   goal is to improve  usefulness and relevance of financial reporting for stakeholders
  including   prudential regulators
 it has issued publicly and made available to  iasb a set of high level   guiding principles  should govern  reforms to  replacement of ias 39
 the  committee   supports an el approach  captures actual losses more transparently and is also less  procyclical than  current incurred loss approach
    24
   second
 it is updating its supervisory guidance to be consistent with  move to such an  el   approach
 such guidance will assist supervisors in promoting strong provisioning practices  under    desired el approach
    25
   third
 it is addressing incentives to stronger provisioning in  regulatory capital   framework
    capital conservation  26
   the committee is introducing a framework to promote  conservation of capital and     build-up of adequate buffers above  minimum  can be drawn down in periods of stress
    27
   at  onset of  financial crisis
 a number of banks continued to make large  distributions   in  form of dividends
 share buy backs and generous compensation payments even though  ir   individual financial condition and  outlook for  sector were deteriorating
 much of this   activity was driven by a collective action problem
 where reductions in distributions were   perceived as sending a signal of weakness
 however
 se actions made individual banks and     sector as a whole less resilient
 many banks soon returned to profitability but did not do  enough   to rebuild ir capital buffers to support new lending activity
 taken toger
 this dynamic  has   increased  procyclicality of  system
    28
   to address this market failure
  committee is introducing a framework  will give   supervisors stronger tools to promote capital conservation in  banking sector
  implementation of    framework through internationally agreed capital conservation standards will help  increase   sector resilience going into a downturn and will provide  mechanism for rebuilding capital   during  economic recovery
 moreover
  framework is sufficiently flexible to allow for a  range of supervisory and bank responses consistent with    standard

 available at              excess credit growth  29
   as witnessed during  financial crisis
 losses incurred in  banking sector during a   downturn preceded by a period of excess credit growth can be extremely large
 such losses  can   destabilise  banking sector
 which can bring about or exacerbate a downturn in  real  economy
   this in turn can furr destabilise  banking sector
 these inter
linkages highlight    particular importance of  banking sector building up its capital defences in periods when  credit   has grown to excessive levels
 the building up of se defences should have  additional  benefit   of helping to moderate excess credit growth
    30
   the basel committee is introducing a regime which will adjust  capital buffer range
   established through  capital conservation mechanism outlined in  previous section
  when re   are signs  credit has grown to excessive levels
 the purpose of  countercyclical buffer  is   to achieve  broader macroprudential goal of protecting  banking sector in periods of  excess   aggregate credit growth
    31
   the measures to address procyclicality are designed to complement each or
 the  initiatives   on provisioning focus on strengning  banking system against expected losses
 while    capital measures focus on unexpected losses
 among  capital measures
 re is a  distinction   between addressing  cyclicality of  minimum and building additional buffers above    minimum
 indeed
 strong capital buffers above  minimum requirement have proven to be  critical
   even in  absence of a cyclical minimum
 finally
  requirement to address excess credit  growth   is set at zero in normal times and only increases during periods of excessive credit availability
   however
 even in  absence of a credit bubble
 supervisors expect  banking sector to  build a   buffer above  minimum to protect it against plausibly severe shocks
 which could emanate  from   many sources
      5
   addressing systemic risk and interconnectedness  32
   while  procyclicality  amplified  shocks  over    time  dimension
  excessive   interconnectedness among systemically important banks also transmitted shocks across   financial   system and economy
 systemically important banks should have loss absorbing capacity  beyond    minimum standards and  work on this issue is ongoing
 the basel committee and   financial   stability board are developing a well integrated approach to systemically important financial   institutions which could include combinations of capital surcharges
 contingent capital and  bail-in   debt
 as part of this effort
  committee is developing a proposal on a methodology  comprising   both quantitative and qualitative indicators to assess  systemic importance of financial   institutions at a global level
 the committee is also conducting a study of  magnitude of   additional loss absorbency  globally systemic financial institutions should have
 along with  an   assessment of  extent of going concern loss absorbency which could be provided by   various   proposed instruments
 the committee  analysis has also covered furr measures to  mitigate    risks or externalities associated with systemic banks
 including liquidity surcharges
 tighter   large exposure restrictions and enhanced supervision
 it will continue its work on se issues  in    first hall of 2011 in accordance with  processes and timelines set out in  fsb   recommendations
    33
   several of  capital requirements introduced by  committee to mitigate  risks  arising   from firm-level exposures among global financial institutions will also help to address systemic   risk and interconnectedness
 these include
      capital incentives for banks to use central counterparties for over--counter derivatives
  higher capital requirements for trading and derivative activities
 as well as complex   securitisations and off-balance sheet exposures 
eg structured investment vehicles
""
  higher capital requirements for inter-financial sector exposures
 and   introduction of liquidity requirements  penalise excessive reliance on short term
   interbank funding to support longer dated assets
      b
   introducing a global liquidity standard  34
   strong capital requirements are a necessary condition for banking sector stability but by   mselves are not sufficient
 a strong liquidity base reinforced through robust supervisory   standards is of equal importance
 to date
 however
 re have been no internationally  harmonised   standards in this area
 the basel committee is refore introducing internationally  harmonised   global liquidity standards
 as with  global capital standards
  liquidity standards will   establish minimum requirements and will promote an international level playing field to help   prevent a competitive race to  bottom
    35
   during  early liquidity phase of  financial crisis
 many banks  despite adequate   capital levels  still experienced difficulties because y did not manage ir liquidity in a   prudent manner
 the crisis again drove home  importance of liquidity to  proper  functioning   of financial markets and  banking sector
 prior to  crisis
 asset markets were buoyant  and   funding was readily available at low cost
 the rapid reversal in market conditions illustrated  how   quickly liquidity can evaporate and  illiquidity can last for an extended period of time
 the   banking system came under severe stress
 which necessitated central bank action to support  both    functioning of money markets and
 in some cases
 individual institutions
    36
   the difficulties experienced by some banks were due to lapses in basic principles of   liquidity risk management
 in response
 as  foundation of its liquidity framework
   committee   in 2008 published principles for sound liquidity risk management and supervision
 the sound   principles provide detailed guidance on  risk management and supervision of funding  liquidity   risk and should help promote better risk management in this critical area
 but only if re is   full implementation by banks and supervisors
 as such
  committee will coordinate  rigorous   follow up by supervisors to ensure  banks adhre to se fundamental principles
    37
   to complement se principles
  committee has furr strengned its liquidity   framework by developing two minimum standards for funding liquidity
 an additional  component of    liquidity framework is a set of monitoring metrics to improve cross-border supervisory  consistency
    38
   these standards have been developed to achieve two separate but complementary  objectives
 the   first objective is to promote short-term resilience of a bank  liquidity risk profile by ensuring    it has sufficient high quality liquid resources to survive an acute stress scenario lasting   for one month
 the committee developed  liquidity coverage ratio 
lcr
 to achieve this   objective
 the second objective is to promote resilience over a longer time horizon by creating  additional incentives for a bank to fund its activities with more   stable sources of funding on an ongoing structural basis
 the net stable funding ratio 
nsfr
  has a   time horizon of one year and has been developed to provide a sustainable maturity structure  of   assets and liabilities
    39
   these two standards are comprised mainly of specific parameters which are  internationally   harmonised with prescribed values
 certain parameters contain elements of national  discretion to   reflect jurisdiction-specific conditions
 in se cases
  parameters should be transparent  and   clearly outlined in  regulations of each jurisdiction to provide clarity both within    jurisdiction and internationally
      1
   liquidity coverage ratio  40
   the lcr is intended to promote resilience to potential liquidity disruptions over a thirty   day horizon
 it will help ensure  global banks have sufficient unencumbered
 high
quality   liquid assets to offset  net cash outflows it could encounter under an acute short
term  stress   scenario
 the specified scenario is built upon circumstances experienced in  global financial   crisis  began in 2007 and entails both institution-specific and systemic shocks
 the scenario   entails a significant stress
 albeit not a worst-case scenario
 and assumes  following
    a significant downgrade of  institution  public credit rating
  a partial loss of deposits
  a loss of unsecured wholesale funding
  a significant increase in secured funding haircuts
 and  increases in derivative collateral calls and substantial calls on contractual and non
  contractual off-balance sheet exposures
 including committed credit and liquidity facilities
  41
   high-quality liquid assets held in  stock should be unencumbered
 liquid in markets  during   a time of stress and
 ideally
 be central bank eligible
      2
   net stable funding ratio  42
   the nsfr requires a minimum amount of stable sources of funding at a bank relative to     liquidity profiles of  assets
 as well as  potential for contingent liquidity needs arising   from off-balance sheet commitments
 over a one-year horizon
 the nsfr aims to limit over- reliance   on short-term wholesale funding during times of buoyant market liquidity and encourage  better   assessment of liquidity risk across all on
and off-balance sheet items
      3
   monitoring tools  43
   at present
 supervisors use a wide range of quantitative measures to monitor  liquidity   risk profiles of banking organisations as well as across  financial sector
 for a   macroprudential approach to supervision
 a survey of basel committee members conducted  in early   2009 identified  more than 25 different measures and concepts are used globally by  supervisors
   to introduce more consistency internationally
  committee has developed a set of common  metrics    should be considered as  minimum types of information which supervisors should use
  in   addition
 supervisors may use additional metrics in order to capture specific risks in ir   jurisdictions
 the monitoring metrics include  following and may evolve furr as   committee conducts furr work
 one area in particular where more work   on monitoring tools will be conducted relates to intraday liquidity risk
    
a
   contractual maturity mismatch
 to gain an understanding of  basic aspects of a bank    liquidity needs
 banks should frequently conduct a contractual maturity mismatch assessment
  this   metric provides an initial
 simple baseline of contractual commitments and is useful in  comparing   liquidity risk profiles across institutions
 and to highlight to both banks and supervisors when   potential liquidity needs could arise
    
b
   concentration of funding
 this metric involves analysing concentrations of wholesale  funding   provided by specific counterparties
 instruments and currencies
 a metric covering  concentrations   of wholesale funding assists supervisors in assessing  extent to which funding liquidity risks   could occur in  event  one or more of  funding sources are withdrawn
    
c
   available  unencumbered  assets
  this  metric  measures    amount  of unencumbered  assets   a bank has which could potentially be used as collateral for secured funding eir in   market   or at standing central bank facilities

 minimum capital requirements and buffers      48
   the global banking system entered  crisis with an insufficient level of high quality   capital
 the crisis also revealed  inconsistency in  definition of capital across   jurisdictions and  lack of disclosure  would have enabled  market to fully assess and   compare  quality of capital across jurisdictions
 a key element of  new definition of  capital   is  greater focus on common equity

   detailed proposal  51
"   throughout this section  term bank"" is used to mean bank"
 banking group or or  entity   
eg holding company
 whose capital is being measured
                as set out in  committee  august 2010 consultative document
 proposal to ensure  loss   absorbency of regulatory capital at  point of non-viability
 and as stated in  committee   19   october 2010 and 1 december 2010 press releases
  committee is finalising additional  entry   criteria for additional tier 1 and tier 2 capital
 once finalised
  additional criteria will be   added to this regulatory framework
        1
   common equity tier 1  52
   common equity tier 1 capital consists of  sum of  following elements
    common shares issued by  bank  meet  criteria for classification as common shares   for regulatory purposes 
or  equivalent for non-joint stock companies
""
  stock surplus 
share premium
 resulting from  issue of instruments included common  equity   tier 1
  retained earnings
  accumulated or comprehensive income and or disclosed reserves
  common shares issued by consolidated subsidiaries of  bank and held by third parties 
ie   minority interest
  meet  criteria for inclusion in common equity tier 1 capital
 see   section 4 for  relevant criteria
 and  regulatory adjustments applied in  calculation of common equity tier 1  retained earnings and or comprehensive income include interim profit or loss
 national   authorities may consider appropriate audit
 verification or review procedures
 dividends are   removed from common equity tier 1 in accordance with applicable accounting standards
 the  treatment   of minority interest and  regulatory adjustments applied in  calculation of common  equity   tier 1 are addressed in separate sections
    common shares issued by  bank  53
   for an instrument to be included in common equity tier 1 capital it must meet all of    criteria  follow
 the vast majority of internationally active banks are structured as joint   stock companies and for se banks  criteria must be met solely with common shares
 in     rare cases where banks need to issue non-voting common shares as part of common equity  tier 1
 y   must be identical to voting common shares of  issuing bank in all respects except   absence of   voting rights
    there is no adjustment applied to remove from common equity tier 1 unrealised gains or  losses   recognised on  balance sheet
 unrealised losses are subject to  transitional  arrangements set   out in paragraph 94  
c
 and 
d
""
 the committee will continue to review  appropriate treatment of unrealised  gains
   taking into account  evolution of  accounting framework
  joint stock companies are defined as companies  have issued common shares
 irrespective  of   wher se shares are held privately or publically
 these will represent  vast majority of   internationally active banks
      criteria for classification as common shares for regulatory capital purposes  1
  represents  most subordinated claim in liquidation of  bank
    2
  entitled to a claim on  residual assets  is proportional with its share of issued   capital
 after all senior claims have been repaid in liquidation 
ie has an unlimited and variable   claim
 not a fixed or capped claim
""
    3
  principal is perpetual  and never repaid outside of liquidation 
setting aside discretionary   repurchases or or means of effectively reducing capital in a discretionary manner  is   allowable under relevant law
""
    4
  the bank does nothing to create an expectation at issuance   instrument will be  bought   back
 redeemed or cancelled nor do  statutory or contractual terms provide any feature  which   might give rise to such an expectation
    5
  distributions are paid out of distributable items 
retained earnings included
""
 the level of   distributions is not in any way tied or linked to  amount paid in at issuance and is not  subject   to a contractual cap 
except to  extent  a bank is unable to pay distributions  exceed    level of distributable items
""
    6
  there are no circumstances under which  distributions are obligatory
 non payment is   refore not an event of default
    7
  distributions are paid only after all legal and contractual obligations have been met and   payments on more senior capital instruments have been made
 this means  re are no   preferential distributions
 including in respect of or elements classified as  highest   quality issued capital
    8
  it is  issued capital  takes  first and proportionately greatest share of any losses   as y occur
 within  highest quality capital
 each instrument absorbs losses on a going   concern basis proportionately and pari passu with all  ors
    9
  the paid in amount is recognised as equity capital 
ie not recognised as a liability
 for   determining balance sheet insolvency
    10
  the paid in amount is classified as equity under  relevant accounting standards
    11
  it is directly issued and paid-in and  bank can not directly or indirectly have funded    purchase of  instrument
      the criteria also apply to non joint stock companies
 such as mutuals
 cooperatives or savings   institutions
 taking into account ir specific constitution and legal structure
 the application   of  criteria should preserve  quality of  instruments by requiring  y are  deemed   fully equivalent to common shares in terms of ir capital quality as regards loss absorption  and   do not possess features which could cause  condition of  bank to be weakened as a  going   concern during periods of market stress
 supervisors will exchange information on how y  apply    criteria to non joint stock companies in order to ensure consistent implementation
  in cases where capital instruments have a permanent write-down feature
 this criterion is still   deemed to be met by common shares
      12
  the paid in amount is neir secured nor covered by a guarantee of  issuer or related   entity or subject to any or arrangement  legally or economically enhances  seniority  of    claim
    13
  it is only issued with  approval of  owners of  issuing bank
 eir given directly   by  owners or
 if permitted by applicable law
 given by  board of directors or by or   persons duly authorised by  owners

   goodwill and all or intangibles must be deducted in  calculation of common equity  tier   1
 including any goodwill included in  valuation of significant investments in  capital of   banking
 financial and insurance entities  are outside  scope of regulatory consolidation
   with  exception of mortgage servicing rights
  full amount is to be deducted net of any   associated deferred tax liability which would be extinguished if  intangible assets become  impaired or derecognised under  relevant accounting standards
 the   amount to be deducted in respect of mortgage servicing rights is set out in  threshold   deductions section below
        assets  relate to  operation of  spv may be excluded from this assessment if y  are   de minimis
          68
   subject to prior supervisory approval
 banks  report under local gaap may use   ifrs   definition of intangible assets to determine which assets are classified as intangible and are  thus   required to be deducted
    deferred tax assets  69
   deferred tax assets 
dtas
  rely on future profitability of  bank to be realised are   to be deducted in  calculation of common equity tier 1
 deferred tax assets may be netted  with   associated deferred tax liabilities 
dtls
 only if  dtas and dtls relate to taxes levied by    same taxation authority and offsetting is permitted by  relevant taxation authority
 where  se   dtas relate to temporary differences 
eg allowance for credit losses
"  amount to be  deducted is   set out in  threshold deductions"" section below"
 aii or such assets
 eg those relating to   operating losses
 such as  carry forward of unused tax losses
 or unused tax credits
 are to  be   deducted in full net of deferred tax liabilities as described above
 the dtls permitted to be   netted against dtas must exclude amounts  have been netted against  deduction of  goodwill
   intangibles and defined benefit pension assets
 and must be allocated on a pro rata basis  between   dtas subject to  threshold deduction treatment and dtas  are to be deducted in full
    70
   an overinstallment of tax or
 in some jurisdictions
 current year tax losses carried back to   prior years may give rise to a claim or receivable from  government or local tax authority
  such   amounts are typically classified as current tax assets for accounting purposes
 the recovery of   such a claim or receivable would not rely on  future profitability of  bank and would be   assigned  relevant sovereign risk weighting
    cash flow hedge reserve  71
   the amount of  cash flow hedge reserve  relates to  hedging of items  are  not   fair valued on  balance sheet 
including projected cash flows
 should be derecognised in     calculation of common equity tier 1
 this means  positive amounts should be deducted  and   negative amounts should be added back
    72
   this treatment specifically identifies  element of  cash flow hedge reserve  is  to   be derecognised for prudential purposes
 it removes  element  gives rise to artificial   volatility in common equity
 as in this case  reserve only reflects one hall of  picture 
   fair value of  derivative
 but not  changes in fair value of  hedged future cash flow
""
    shortfall of  stock of provisions to expected losses  73
   the deduction from capital in respect of a shortfall of  stock of provisions to expected   losses under  irb approach should be made in  calculation of common equity tier 1

    defined benefit pension fund assets and liabilities  76
   defined benefit pension fund liabilities
 as included on  balance sheet

ie common equity tier 1 cannot be  increased   through derecognising se liabilities
""
 for each defined benefit pension fund  is an asset  on    balance sheet
  asset should be deducted in  calculation of common equity tier 1  net of   any associated deferred tax liability which would be extinguished if  asset should become   impaired or derecognised under  relevant accounting standards
 assets in  fund to  which    bank has unrestricted and unfettered access can

 offset   deduction
   such offsetting assets should be given  risk weight y would receive if y were owned   directly by  bank

 in addition
 any own stock which  bank could be  contractually   obliged to purchase should be deducted in  calculation of common equity tier 1
 the  treatment   described will apply irrespective of  location of  exposure in  banking book or    trading book
 in addition
    gross long positions may be deducted net of short positions in  same underlying exposure   only if  short positions involve no counterparty risk
  banks should look through holdings of index securities to deduct exposures to own shares
   however
 gross long positions in own shares resulting from holdings of index securities may  be   netted against short position in own shares resulting from short positions in  same  underlying   index
 in such cases  short positions may involve counterparty risk 
which will be subject  to    relevant counterparty credit risk charge
""
    this deduction is necessary to avoid  double counting of a bank  own capital
 certain   accounting regimes do not permit  recognition of treasury stock and so this deduction is  only   relevant where recognition on  balance sheet is permitted
 the treatment seeks to remove     double counting  arises from direct holdings
 indirect holdings via index funds and  potential   future holdings as a result of contractual obligations to purchase own shares
    following  same approach outlined above
 banks must deduct investments in ir own  additional   tier 1 in  calculation of ir additional tier 1 capital and must deduct investments in ir   own tier 2 in  calculation of ir tier 2 capital

 more  specifically
    existing paragraph 56
 annex 4
 of  basel il text will be replaced with  following
    56
   banks must have a comprehensive stress testing program for counterparty credit risk
  the   stress testing program must include  following elements
    banks must ensure complete trade capture and exposure aggregation across all forms of   counterparty credit risk 
not just otc derivatives
 at  counterparty-specific level in a   sufficient time frame to conduct regular stress testing
  for all counterparties
 banks should produce
 at least monthly
 exposure stress testing of   principal market risk factors 
eg interest rates
 fx
 equities
 credit spreads
 and commodity   prices
 in order to proactively identify
 and when necessary
 reduce outsized concentrations  to   specific directional sensitivities
  banks should apply multifactor stress testing scenarios and assess material non-directional   risks 
ie yield curve exposure
 basis risks
 etc
 at least quarterly
 multiple-factor stress tests   should
 at a minimum
 aim to address scenarios in which a
 severe economic or market events  have   occurred
 b
 broad market liquidity has decreased significantly
 and c
  market impact of   liquidating positions of a large financial intermediary
 these stress tests may be part of   bank-wide stress testing
  stressed market movements have an impact not only on counterparty exposures
 but also on     credit quality of counterparties
 at least quarterly
 banks should conduct stress testing  applying   stressed conditions to  joint movement of exposures and counterparty creditworthiness
  exposure stress testing

 multifactor and material non-directional   risks
 and joint stressing of exposure and creditworthiness should be performed at    counterparty-specific
 counterparty group

""
 and  relevant   portfolio and counterparty specific trends
  the severity of factor shocks should be consistent with  purpose of  stress test
 when   evaluating solvency under stress
" factor shocks should be severe enough to capture historical   extreme market environments and/or extreme but plausible stressed market conditions"
 the  impact of   such shocks on capital resources should be evaluated
 as well as  impact on capital  requirements   and earnings
 for  purpose of day-to-day portfolio monitoring
 hedging
 and management  of   concentrations
 banks should also consider scenarios of lesser severity and higher probability
  banks should consider reverse stress tests to identify extreme
 but plausible
 scenarios    could result in significant adverse outcomes
  senior management must take a lead role in  integration of stress testing into  risk   management framework and risk culture of  bank and ensure   results are  meaningful and   proactively used to manage counterparty credit risk

   it is important  supervisory authorities are able to assure mselves  banks using   models have counterparty credit risk management systems  are conceptually sound and  implemented   with integrity
 accordingly  supervisory authority will specify a number of qualitative  criteria    banks would have to meet before y are permitted to use a models-based approach

 only   those banks in full compliance with  qualitative criteria will be eligible for application of    minimum multiplication factor
 the qualitative criteria include
    the bank must conduct a regular programme of backtesting

 as well as comparing  hypotical   changes based on static positions with realised measures
  the bank must carry out an initial validation and an on-going periodic review of its imm model   and  risk measures generated by it
 the validation and review must be independent of   model   developers
  the board of directors and senior management should be actively involved in  risk control   process and must regard credit and counterparty credit risk control as an essential aspect of     business to which significant resources need to be devoted
 in this regard
  daily reports   prepared by  independent risk control unit must be reviewed by a level of management   with   sufficient  seniority and authority  to enforce both reductions of positions taken by individual   traders and reductions in  bank  overall risk exposure
  the bank  internal risk measurement exposure model must be closely integrated into    day-to-day risk management process of  bank
 its output should accordingly be an integral  part   of  process of planning
 monitoring and controlling  bank  counterparty credit risk  profile
  the risk measurement system should be used in conjunction with internal trading and  exposure   limits
 in this regard

 controls and procedures concerning   operation  of    risk  measurement  system
    the  bank   risk measurement system must be well documented
 for example
 through a risk   management manual  describes  basic principles of  risk management system and     provides an explanation of  empirical techniques used to measure counterparty credit risk
  an independent review of  risk measurement system should be carried out regularly in    bank  own internal auditing process

    following requirements must be met
    a bank must carry out backtesting using historical data on movements in market risk factors   prior to supervisory approval
 backtesting must consider a number of distinct prediction time   horizons out to at least one year
 over a range of various start 
initialisation
 dates and   covering a wide range of market conditions
    banks must backtest  performance of ir epe model and  model  relevant risk  measures   as well as  market risk factor predictions  support epe
 for collateralised trades
"    prediction time horizons considered must include those reflecting typical margin periods of  risk   applied in collateralised/margined trading"
 and must include long time horizons of at least 1  year
  the pricing models used to calculate counterparty credit risk exposure for a given scenario of   future shocks to market risk factors must be tested as part of  initial and on-going model   validation process
 these pricing models may be different from those used to calculate market  risk   over a short horizon
 pricing models for options must account for  nonlinearity of option  value   with respect to market risk factors
  an epe model must capture transaction specific information in order to aggregate exposures  at    level of  netting set
 banks must verify  transactions are assigned to  appropriate   netting set within  model
  static
 historical backtesting on representative counterparty portfolios must be a part of    validation process
 at regular intervals as directed by its supervisor
 a bank must conduct such   backtesting on a number of representative counterparty portfolios
 the representative  portfolios   must be chosen based on ir sensitivity to  material risk factors and correlations to which    bank is exposed
 in addition
 imm banks need to conduct backtesting  is designed to  test    key assumptions of  epe model and  relevant risk measures
 eg  modelled  relationship   between tenors of  same risk factor
 and  modelled relationships between risk factors
  significant differences between realised exposures and  forecast distribution could   indicate a problem with  model or  underlying data   supervisor would require   bank   to correct
 under such circumstances
 supervisors may require additional capital to be held  while    problem is being solved
  the performance of epe models and its risk measures must be subject to good backtesting   practice
 the backtesting programme must be capable of identifying poor performance in an  epe   model  risk measures
  banks must validate ir epe models and all relevant risk measures out to time horizons   commensurate with  maturity of trades for which exposure is calculated using an internal   modelling method
  the pricing models used to calculate counterparty exposure must be regularly tested against   appropriate independent benchmarks as part of  on-going model validation process
  the on-going validation of a bank  epe model and  relevant risk measures include an   assessment of recent performance
  the frequency with which  parameters of an epe model are updated needs to be assessed  as   part of  validation process
  under  imm
 a measure  is more conservative than  metric used to calculate   regulatory ead for every counterparty
 may be used in place of alpha times effective epe with     prior approval of  supervisor
 the degree of relative conservatism will be assessed upon  initial   supervisory approval and at  regular supervisory reviews of  epe models
 the bank must   validate  conservatism regularly
  the on-going assessment of model performance needs to cover all counterparties for which     models are used
  the validation of imm models must assess wher or not  bank level and netting set   exposure calculations of epe are appropriate

  capital conservation buffer  122
   this section outlines  operation of  capital conservation buffer
 which is designed  to   ensure  banks build up capital buffers outside periods of stress which can be drawn down  as   losses are incurred
 the requirement is based on simple capital conservation rules designed  to   avoid breaches of minimum capital requirements
      a
   capital conservation best practice  123
   outside of periods of stress
 banks should hold buffers of capital above  regulatory   minimum
    124
   when buffers have been drawn down
 one way banks should look to rebuild m is  through   reducing discretionary distributions of earnings
 this could include reducing dividend  payments
   share-backs and staff bonus payments
 banks may also choose to raise new capital from   private   sector as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital
      the balance between se options should be discussed with supervisors as part of  capital   planning process
    125
   it is clear  greater efforts should be made to rebuild buffers  more y have  been   depleted
 therefore
 in  absence of raising capital in  private sector
  share of  earnings   retained by banks for  purpose of rebuilding ir capital buffers should increase  nearer   ir actual capital levels are to  minimum capital requirement
    126
  it is not acceptable for banks which have depleted ir capital buffers to use future   predictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders
   or capital providers and employees
 these stakeholders
 rar than depositors
 must bear     risk  recovery will not be forthcoming
    127
   it is also not acceptable for banks which have depleted ir capital buffers to try and  use    distribution of capital as a way to signal ir financial strength
 not only is this   irresponsible from  perspective of an individual bank
 putting shareholders interests above   depositors
 it may also encourage or banks to follow suit
 as a consequence
 banks in  aggregate   can end up increasing distributions at  exact point in time when y should be conserving   earnings
    128
   the framework reduces  discretion of banks which have depleted ir capital buffers  to   furr reduce m through generous distributions of earnings
 in doing so
  framework  will   strengn ir ability to withstand adverse environments
 implementation of   framework through   internationally agreed capital conservation rules will help increase sector resilience both going   into a downturn
 and provide  mechanism for rebuilding capital during  early stages of   economic recovery
 retaining a greater proportion of earnings during a downturn will help  ensure    capital remains available to support  ongoing business operations of banks through     period of stress
 in this way  framework should help reduce procyclicality
      b
   the framework  129
   a capital conservation buffer of 2
5%
 comprised of common equity tier 1
 is established   above  regulatory minimum capital requirement
 capital distribution constraints will be   imposed on a bank when capital levels fall within this range
 banks will be able to conduct   business as normal when ir capital levels fall into  conservation range as y experience   losses
 the constraints imposed only relate to distributions
 not  operation of  bank
    130
   the distribution constraints imposed on banks when ir capital levels fall into   range   increase as  banks capital levels approach  minimum requirements
 by design
   constraints   imposed on banks with capital levels at  top of  range would be minimal
 this reflects  an   expectation  banks capital levels will from time to time fall into this range
 the basel   committee does not wish to impose constraints for entering  range  would be so  restrictive   as to result in  range being viewed as establishing a new minimum capital requirement
          common equity tier 1 must first be used to meet  minimum capital requirements 
including     6% tier 1 and 8% total capital requirements if necessary
""
 before  remainder can contribute  to    capital conservation buffer
    131
   the table below shows  minimum capital conservation ratios a bank must meet at  various   levels of  common equity tier 1 
cet1
 capital ratios
 for example
 a bank with a cet1  capital   ratio in  range of 5
125% to 5
75% is required to conserve 80% of its earnings in   subsequent   financial year 
ie payout no more than 20% in terms of dividends
 share buybacks and  discretionary   bonus payments
""
 if  bank wants to make payments in excess of  constraints imposed  by this   regime
 it would have  option of raising capital in  private sector equal to  amount  above    constraint which it wishes to distribute
 this would be discussed with  bank  supervisor  as   part of  capital planning process
 the common equity tier 1 ratio includes amounts used  to meet    4
5% minimum common equity tier 1 requirement
 but excludes any additional common  equity tier 1   needed to meet  6% tier 1 and 8% total capital requirements
 for example
 a bank with 8%  cet1   and no additional tier 1 or tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements
 but  would   have a zero conservation buffer and refore by subject to  100% constraint on capital   distributions
    individual bank minimum capital conservation standards    common equity tier 1 ratio minimum capital conservation ratios

0% 0%                  132
   set out below are a number of or key aspects of  requirements
    
a
     elements subject to  restriction on distributions
 items considered to be distributions   include dividends and share buybacks
 discretionary payments on or  tier  1  capital    instruments  and  discretionary  bonus  payments  to  staff
 payments  do not result in a   depletion of common equity tier 1
 which may for example include certain scrip dividends
  are not   considered distributions
    
b
     definition of earnings
 earnings are defined as distributable profits calculated prior to    deduction of elements subject to  restriction on distributions
 earnings are calculated    after    tax  which  would  have  been  reported  had  none  of   distributable items been   paid
 as such
 any tax impact of making such distributions are reversed out
 where a bank  does not   have positive earnings and has a common equity tier 1 ratio less than 7%
 it would be  restricted   from making positive net distributions
    
c
     solo or consolidated  application
  the framework  should be applied  at  consolidated   level
 ie restrictions would be imposed on distributions out of  consolidated group
 national   supervisors would have  option of applying  regime at  solo level to conserve  resources in   specific parts of  group
    
d
     additional supervisory discretion
 although  buffer must be capable of being drawn  down
   banks should not choose in normal times to operate in  buffer range simply to compete  with or   banks and win market share
 to ensure  this does not happen
 supervisors have   additional   discretion to impose time limits on banks operating within  buffer range on a case-by-case   basis
 in any case
 supervisors should ensure   capital plans of banks seek to rebuild  buffers over an   appropriate timeframe
      c
   transitional arrangements  133
   the capital conservation buffer will be phased in between 1 january 2016 and year end  2018   becoming fully effective on 1 january 2019
 it will begin at 0
625% of rwas on 1 january 2016  and   increase each subsequent year by an additional 0
625 percentage points
 to reach its final level  of   2
5% of rwas on 1 january 2019
 countries  experience excessive credit growth should  consider   accelerating  build up of  capital conservation buffer and  countercyclical buffer
   national authorities have  discretion to impose shorter transition periods and should do so   where appropriate
    134
  banks  already meet  minimum ratio requirement during  transition period  but remain   below  7% common equity tier 1 target 
minimum plus conservation buffer
 should  maintain prudent   earnings retention policies with a view to meeting  conservation buffer as soon as  reasonably   possible
    135
   the division of  buffer into quartiles  determine  minimum capital  conservation   ratios will begin on 1 january 2016
 these quartiles will expand as  capital conservation  buffer   is phased in and will take into account any countercyclical buffer in effect during this period
        iv
  countercyclical buffer  a
   introduction  136
   losses incurred in  banking sector can be extremely large when a downturn is  preceded by   a period of excess credit growth
 these losses can destabilise  banking sector and spark a   vicious circle
 whereby problems in  financial system can contribute to a downturn in   real   economy  n feeds back on to  banking sector
 these interactions highlight   particular   importance of  banking sector building up additional capital defences in periods where   risks   of system-wide stress are growing markedly
    137
   the countercyclical buffer aims to ensure  banking sector capital requirements take   account of  macro-financial environment in which banks operate
 it will be deployed by  national   jurisdictions when excess aggregate credit growth is judged to be associated with a build-up  of   system-wide risk to ensure  banking system has a buffer of capital to protect it against  future   potential losses
 this focus on excess aggregate credit growth means  jurisdictions are  likely   to only need to deploy  buffer on an infrequent basis
 the buffer for internationally-active   banks will be a weighted average of  buffers deployed across all  jurisdictions to which  it   has credit exposures
 this means  y will likely find mselves subject to a small buffer  on   a more frequent basis
 since credit cycles are not always highly correlated across jurisdictions
    138
  the countercyclical buffer regime consists of  following elements
    
a
    national authorities will monitor credit growth and or indicators  may signal a  build   up of system-wide risk and make assessments of wher credit growth is excessive and is  leading to    build up of system-wide risk
 based on this assessment y will put in place a  countercyclical   buffer requirement when circumstances warrant
 this requirement will be released when  system-wide risk crystallises or   dissipates
    
b
    internationally active banks will look at  geographic location of ir private sector   credit exposures and calculate ir bank specific countercyclical capital buffer requirement  as a   weighted average of  requirements  are being applied in jurisdictions to which y  have   credit exposures
    
c
    the countercyclical buffer requirement to which a bank is subject will extend  size of    capital conservation buffer
 banks will be subject to restrictions on distributions if y do   not meet  requirement
      b
   national countercyclical buffer requirements  139
   each basel committee member jurisdiction will identify an authority with   responsibility   to make decisions on  size of  countercyclical capital buffer
 if  relevant national   authority judges a period of excess credit growth to be leading to  build up of system-wide   risk
 y will consider
 toger with any or macroprudential tools at ir disposal
  putting   in place a countercyclical buffer requirement
 this will vary between zero and 2
5% of risk   weighted assets
 depending on ir judgement as to  extent of  build up of system- wide   risk
    140
   the  document  entitled  guidance  for  national  authorities  operating     countercyclical capital buffer
 sets out  principles  national authorities have agreed to   follow in making buffer decisions
 this document provides information  should help banks  to   understand and anticipate  buffer decisions made by national authorities in   jurisdictions to   which y have credit exposures
    141
   to give banks time to adjust to a buffer level
 a jurisdiction will pre-announce its   decision to raise  level of  countercyclical buffer by up to 12 months
 decisions by a   jurisdiction to decrease  level of  countercyclical buffer will take effect immediately
 the   pre-announced buffer decisions and  actual buffers in place for all committee member   jurisdictions will be published on  bis website
      c
   bank specific countercyclical buffer  142
   banks will be subject to a countercyclical buffer  varies between zero and 2
5% to  total   risk weighted assets
 the buffer  will apply to each bank will reflect  geographic   composition of its portfolio of credit exposures
 banks must meet this buffer with        national authorities can implement a range of additional macroprudential tools
 including a   buffer in excess of 2
5% for banks in ir jurisdiction
 if this is deemed appropriate in ir   national context
 however
  international reciprocity provisions set out in this regime treat    maximum countercyclical buffer as 2
5%
   banks outside of this jurisdiction with credit exposures to counterparties in this jurisdiction   will also be subject to  increased buffer level after  pre-announcement period in respect  of   se exposures
 however
 in cases where  pre-announcement period of a jurisdiction is  shorter   than 12 months
  home authority of such banks should seek to match   preannouncement period   where practical
 or as soon as possible 
subject to a maximum preannouncement period of 12  months
""
   before  new buffer level cornes into effect
  as with  capital conservation buffer
  framework will be applied at  consolidated   level
 in addition
 national supervisors may apply  regime at  solo level to conserve   resources in specific parts of  group
        common equity tier 1 or or fully loss absorbing capital or be subject to  restrictions on   distributions set out in  next section
    143
   internationally active banks will look at  geographic location of ir private sector   credit  exposures  
including  non-bank  financial  sector  exposures
  and  calculate  ir   countercyclical capital buffer requirement as a weighted average of  buffers  are being   applied in jurisdictions to which y have an exposure
 credit exposures in this case include  all   private sector credit exposures  attract a credit risk capital charge or  risk weighted   equivalent trading book capital charges for specific risk
 irc and securitisation
    144
   the weighting applied to  buffer in place in each jurisdiction will be  bank  total   credit risk charge  relates to private sector credit exposures in  jurisdiction
 divided   by  bank  total credit risk charge  relates to private sector credit exposures across all   jurisdictions
    145
   for  var for specific risk
  incremental risk charge and  comprehensive risk   measurement charge
 banks should work with ir supervisors to develop an approach   would   translate se charges into individual instrument risk weights  would n be allocated  to    geographic location of  specific counterparties  make up  charge
 however
 it may  not   always be possible to break down  charges in this way due to  charges being calculated  on a   portfolio by portfolio basis
 in such cases
  charge for  relevant portfolio should be   allocated to  geographic regions of  constituents of  portfolio by calculating    proportion of  portfolio  total exposure at default 
ead
  is due to  ead resulting  from   counterparties in each geographic region
      d
    extension of  capital conservation buffer  146
   the countercyclical buffer requirement to which a bank is subject is implemented  through an   extension of  capital conservation buffer described in section iii
    147
   the table below shows  minimum capital conservation ratios a bank must meet at  various   levels of  common equity tier 1 capital ratio
 when  countercyclical capital buffer is  zero   in all of  regions to which a bank has private sector credit exposures
  capital levels and   restrictions set out in  table are  same as those set out in section iii
      the committee is still reviewing  question of permitting or fully loss absorbing capital   beyond common equity tier 1 and what form it would take
 until  committee has issued  furr   guidance
  countercyclical buffer is to be met with common equity tier 1 only
  when considering  jurisdiction to which a private sector credit exposure relates
 banks   should use
 where possible
 an ultimate risk basis
 i
e
 it should use  country where    guarantor of  exposure resides
 not where  exposure has been booked
  consistent with  conservation buffer
  common equity tier 1 ratio in this context  includes   amounts used to meet  4
5% minimum common equity tier 1 requirement
 but excludes  any additional   common equity tier 1 needed to meet  6% tier 1 and 8% total capital requirements

    frequency of calculation and disclosure  149
   banks must ensure  ir countercyclical buffer requirements are calculated and   publically disclosed with at least  same frequency as ir minimum capital requirements
  the   buffer should be based on  latest relevant jurisdictional countercyclical buffers  are   available at  date  y calculate ir minimum capital requirement
 in addition
 when    disclosing  ir  buffer  requirement
  banks  must  also  disclose    geographic breakdown  of   ir private sector credit exposures used in  calculation of  buffer requirement
      f
    transitional arrangements  150
   the countercyclical buffer regime will be phased-in  in parallel with  capital   conservation buffer between 1 january 2016 and year end 2018 becoming fully effective on 1  january   2019
 this means   maximum countercyclical buffer requirement will begin at 0
625%  of rwas   on 1 january 2016 and increase each subsequent year by an additional 0
625 percentage  points
 to   reach its final maximum of 2
5% of rwas on 1 january 2019
 countries  experience  excessive   credit growth during this transition period will consider accelerating  build up of  capital   conservation buffer and  countercyclical buffer
 in addition
 jurisdictions may choose to   implement larger countercyclical buffer requirements
 in such cases  reciprocity provisions  of    regime will not apply to  additional amounts or earlier time-frames
        v
   leverage ratio  a
   rationale and objective  151
   one of  underlying features of  crisis was  build-up of excessive on
and   off-balance sheet leverage in  banking system
 in many cases
 banks built up excessive  leverage   while still showing strong risk based capital ratios
 during  most severe part of  crisis
    banking sector was forced by  market to reduce its leverage in a manner  amplified   downward pressure on asset prices
 furr exacerbating  positive feedback loop between  losses
   declines in bank capital
 and contraction in credit availability
    152
  therefore
  committee agreed to introduce a simple
 transparent
 non-risk based  leverage   ratio  is calibrated to act as a credible supplementary measure to  risk based capital   requirements
 the leverage ratio is intended to achieve  following objectives
    constrain  build-up of leverage in  banking sector
 helping avoid destabilising   deleveraging processes which can damage  broader financial system and  economy
 and  reinforce  risk based requirements with a simple
 non-risk based backstop measure
    b
   definition and calculation of  leverage ratio  153
   this section presents  definition and calculation of  leverage ratio
 which would   serve as  basis for testing during  parallel run period
 the basis of calculation is    average of  monthly leverage ratio over  quarter based on  definitions of capital 
   capital measure
 and total exposure 
 exposure measure
 specified in paragraphs 154 to  164
 the   committee will test a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 3% during  parallel run period from  1   january 2013 to 1 january 2017
 additional transitional arrangements are set out in  paragraphs 165   to 167
    1
   capital measure  154
   the capital measure for  leverage ratio should be based on  new definition of tier  1   capital as set out in paragraphs 52 to 56 of this framework
 the committee also will collect  data   during  transition period to track  impact of using total regulatory capital and common   equity tier 1
    155
   items  are deducted completely from capital do not contribute to leverage
 and  should   refore also be deducted from  measure of exposure
 that is
  capital and exposure  should   be measured consistently and should avoid double counting
 this means  deductions from  tier 1   capital 
as set out in paragraphs 66 to 89
 should also be made from  exposure measure
    156
   according to  treatment outlined in paragraphs 84 to 89
 where a financial entity is   included in  accounting consolidation but not in  regulatory consolidation
   investments   in  capital of se entities are required to be deducted to  extent   y exceed   certain thresholds
 to ensure   capital and exposure are measured consistently for    purposes of  leverage ratio
  assets of such entities included in  accounting   consolidation should be excluded from  exposure measure in proportion to  capital   is   excluded under paragraphs 84 to 89
    2
    exposure measure  
i
    general measurement principles  157
   the exposure measure for  leverage ratio should generally follow  accounting  measure   of exposure
 to be measured consistently with financial accounts
  following should apply
    on-balance sheet
 non-derivative exposures are net of specific provisions and valuation   adjustments 
eg credit valuation adjustments
""
  physical or financial collateral
 guarantees or credit risk mitigation purchased is not   allowed to reduce on-balance sheet exposures
 and  netting of loans and deposits is not allowed
    
ii
   on-balance sheet items  158
   banks should include items using ir accounting balance sheet for  purposes of    leverage ratio
 in addition
  exposure measure should include  following treatments for   securities financing transactions 
sft
 and derivatives
    
a
    repurchase agreements and securities finance  159
   sft are a form of secured funding and refore an important source of balance sheet   leverage  should be included in  leverage ratio
 therefore
 banks should calculate sft  for    purposes of  leverage ratio by applying
     accounting measure of exposure
 and   regulatory netting rules based on  basel il framework
     
b
   derivatives  160
   derivatives create two types of exposure
 an on-balance sheet present value reflecting     fair value of  contract 
often zero at outset but subsequently positive or negative  depending on    performance of  contract
""
 and a notional economic exposure representing   underlying   economic interest of  contract
    161
   banks should calculate derivatives
 including where a bank sells protection using a credit   derivative
 for  purposes of  leverage ratio by applying
     accounting measure of exposure plus an add-on for potential future exposure calculated   according to  current exposure method as identified in paragraphs 186
 187 and 317 of   basel   il framework
 this ensures  all derivatives are converted in a consistent manner to a loan   equivalent amount
 and   regulatory netting rules based on  basel il framework
            securities financing transactions are transactions such as repurchase agreements
 reverse   repurchase agreements
 security lending and borrowing
 and margin lending transactions
  where    value of  transactions depends on  market valuations and  transactions are often  subject   to margin agreements
  excepting  rules for cross-product netting in annex 4
 section 3
  excepting  rules for cross-product netting in annex 4

 trade letters of credit
 failed transactions   and unsettled securities
 the treatment of  items included in 83
ii
 and 84
 ie repurchase   agreements and securities financing transactions is addressed above
    163
   the committee recognises  obs items are a source of potentially significant leverage
   therefore
 banks should calculate  above obs items for  purposes of  leverage ratio  by   applying a uniform 100% credit conversion factor 
ccf
""
    164
   for any commitments  are unconditionally cancellable at any time by  bank  without   prior notice
 banks should apply a ccf of 10%
 the committee will conduct furr review to  ensure     10% ccf is appropriately conservative based on historical experience
      c
   transitional arrangements  165
   the transition period for  leverage ratio will commence 1 january 2011
 the  committee   will use  transition period to monitor banks leverage data on a semi-annual basis in order  to   assess wher  proposed design and calibration of  minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of  3% is   appropriate over a full credit cycle and for different types of business models
 this assessment   will include consideration of wher a wider definition of exposures and an offsetting  adjustment   in  calibration would better achieve  objectives of  leverage ratio
 the committee  also   will closely monitor accounting standards and practices to address any differences in national   accounting frameworks  are material to  definition and calculation of  leverage ratio
    166
  the transition period will comprise of a supervisory monitoring period and a parallel run   period
    the supervisory monitoring period commences 1 january 2011
 the supervisory monitoring  process   will focus on developing templates to track in a consistent manner  underlying components  of    agreed definition and resulting ratio
  the parallel run period commences 1 january 2013 and runs until 1 january 2017
 during this   period
  leverage ratio and its components will be tracked
 including its behaviour relative  to    risk based requirement
 banks are required to calculate ir leverage ratio using    definitions of capital and total exposure specified in paragraphs 154 to 164 and ir risk based   capital requirement
 bank level disclosure of  leverage ratio and its components will start  1   january 2015
 the committee will develop a disclosure template and closely monitor  disclosure of    ratio
  167
   based on  results of  parallel run period
 any final adjustments to  definition  and   calibration of  leverage ratio will be carried out in  first hall of 2017
 with a view to   migrating to a pillar 1 treatment on 1 january 2018 based on appropriate review and  calibration
